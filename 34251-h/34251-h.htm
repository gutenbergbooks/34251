<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

  <p>This book deals with the Dialect of the English Language that is
  spoken in Ireland.</p>

  <p>As the Life of a people&mdash;according to our motto&mdash;is pictured
  in their speech, our picture ought to be a good one, for two languages
  were concerned in it&mdash;Irish and English. The part played by each
  will be found specially set forth in Chapters IV and VII; and in farther
  detail throughout the whole book.</p>

  <p>The articles and pamphlets that have already appeared on this
  interesting subject&mdash;which are described below&mdash;are all short.
  Some are full of keen observation; but very many are mere lists of
  dialectical words with their meanings. Here for the first time&mdash;in
  this little volume of mine&mdash;our Anglo-Irish Dialect is subjected to
  detailed analysis and systematic classification.</p>

  <p>I have been collecting materials for this book for more than twenty
  years; not indeed by way of constant work, but off and on as detailed
  below. The sources from which these materials were directly derived are
  mainly the following.</p>

  <p><i>First.</i>&mdash;My own memory is a storehouse both of idiom and
  vocabulary; for the good reason that from childhood to early manhood I
  spoke&mdash;like those among whom I lived&mdash;the rich dialect <!--
  Page vi --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevi"></a>{vi}</span>of
  Limerick and Cork&mdash;and indeed to some extent speak it still in the
  colloquial language of everyday life.</p>

  <p>I have also drawn pretty largely on our Anglo-Irish Folk Songs of
  which I have a great collection, partly in my memory and partly on
  printed sheets; for they often faithfully reflect our Dialect.</p>

  <p><i>Second.</i>&mdash;Eighteen years ago (1892) I wrote a short letter
  which was inserted in nearly all the Irish newspapers and in very many of
  those published outside Ireland, announcing my intention to write a book
  on Anglo-Irish Dialect, and asking for collections of dialectical words
  and phrases. In response to this I received a very large number of
  communications from all parts of Ireland, as well as from outside
  Ireland, even from America, Australia, and New Zealand&mdash;all more or
  less to the point, showing the great and widespread interest taken in the
  subject. Their importance of course greatly varied; but many were very
  valuable. I give at the end of the book an alphabetical list of those
  contributors: and I acknowledge the most important of them throughout the
  book.</p>

  <p><i>Third.</i>&mdash;The works of Irish writers of novels, stories, and
  essays depicting Irish peasant life in which the people are made to speak
  in dialect. Some of these are mentioned in Chapter I., and others are
  quoted throughout the book as occasion requires. <!-- Page vii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagevii"></a>{vii}</span></p>

  <p><i>Fourth.</i>&mdash;Printed articles and pamphlets on the special
  subject of Anglo-Irish Dialect. Of these the principal that I have come
  across are the following:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'The Provincialisms of Belfast and Surrounding District pointed out
  and corrected,' by David Patterson. (1860.)</p>

  <p>'Remarks on the Irish Dialect of the English Language,' by A. Hume,
  <span class="scac">D.C.L.</span> and <span class="scac">LL.D.</span>
  (1878.)</p>

  <p>'A Glossary of Words in use in the Counties of Antrim and Down,' by
  Wm. Hugh Patterson, <span class="scac">M.R.I.A.</span> (1880)&mdash;a
  large pamphlet&mdash;might indeed be called a book.</p>

  <p>'Don't, Pat,' by 'Colonel O'Critical': a very good and useful little
  pamphlet, marred by a silly title which turns up perpetually through the
  whole pamphlet till the reader gets sick of it. (1885.)</p>

  <p>'A List of Peculiar Words and Phrases at one time in use in Armagh and
  South Donegal': by D. A. Simmons. (1890.) This List was annotated by me,
  at the request of Mr. Simmons, who was, at or about that time, President
  of the Irish National Teachers' Association.</p>

  <p>A Series of Six Articles on <i>The English in Ireland</i> by myself,
  printed in 'The Educational Gazette'; Dublin. (1890.)</p>

  <p>'The Anglo-Irish Dialect,' by the Rev. William Burke (an Irish priest
  residing in Liverpool); published in 'The Irish Ecclesiastical Record'
  for 1896. A judicious and scholarly essay, which I have very often used.
  <!-- Page viii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pageviii"></a>{viii}</span></p>

  <p>'The Irish Dialect of English; its Origins and Vocabulary.' By Mary
  Hayden, <span class="scac">M.A.</span>, and Prof. Marcus Hartog
  (jointly): published in 'The Fortnightly Review' (1909: April and May). A
  thoughtful and valuable essay. Miss Hayden knows Irish well, and has made
  full use of her knowledge to illustrate her subject. Of this article I
  have made much use.</p>

  <p>Besides these there were a number of short articles by various writers
  published in Irish newspapers within the last twenty years or so, nearly
  all of them lists of dialectical words used in the North of Ireland.</p>

  <p>In the Introduction to the 'Biglow Papers,' Second Series, James
  Russell Lowell has some valuable observations on modern English
  dialectical words and phrases derived from Old English forms, to which I
  am indebted for much information, and which will be found acknowledged
  through this book: for it touches my subject in many places. In this
  Introduction Mr. Lowell remarks truly:&mdash;'It is always worth while to
  note down the erratic words or phrases one meets with in any dialect.
  They may throw light on the meaning of other words, on the relationship
  of languages, or even history itself.'</p>

  <p>Of all the above I have made use so far as served my
  purpose&mdash;always with acknowledgment.</p>

  <p><i>Fifth.</i> For twenty years or more I have kept a large note-book
  lying just at my hand; and <!-- Page ix --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pageix"></a>{ix}</span>whenever any peculiar Irish-English
  expression, or anything bearing on the subject, came before me&mdash;from
  memory, or from reading, or from hearing it in conversation&mdash;down it
  went in the manuscript. In this way an immense mass of materials was
  accumulated almost imperceptibly.</p>

  <p>The vast collection derived from all the above sources lay by till
  early last year, when I went seriously to work at the book. But all the
  materials were mixed
  up&mdash;<i>three-na-haila</i>&mdash;'through-other'&mdash;and before a
  line of the book was written they had to be perused, selected,
  classified, and alphabetised, which was a very heavy piece of work.</p>

  <p>A number of the Irish items in the great 'Dialect Dictionary' edited
  for the English Dialect Society by Dr. Joseph Wright were contributed by
  me and are generally printed with my initials. I have neither copied nor
  avoided these&mdash;in fact I did not refer to them at all while working
  at my book&mdash;and naturally many&mdash;perhaps most&mdash;of them
  reappear here, probably in different words. But this is quite proper; for
  the Dialect Dictionary is a book of reference&mdash;six large volumes,
  very expensive&mdash;and not within reach of the general public.</p>

  <p>Many of the words given in this book as dialectical are also used by
  the people in the ordinary sense they bear in standard English; such as
  <i>break</i>:&mdash;'Poor Tom was broke yesterday' (dialect: dismissed
  from employment): 'the bowl <!-- Page x --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagex"></a>{x}</span>fell on the flags and was broken in pieces'
  (correct English): and <i>dark</i>: 'a poor dark man' (dialect: blind):
  'a dark night' (correct English).</p>

  <p>This is essentially a subject for popular treatment; and accordingly I
  have avoided technical and scientific details and technical terms: they
  are not needed.</p>

  <p>When a place is named in connexion with a dialectical expression, it
  is not meant that the expression is confined to that place, but merely
  that it is, or was, in use there.</p>

<h2>ENGLISH AS WE SPEAK IT IN IRELAND.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">SOURCES OF ANGLO-IRISH DIALECT.</p>

  <p>Our Anglo-Irish dialectical words and phrases are derived from three
  main sources:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>First</i>: the Irish language.</p>

  <p><i>Second</i>: Old English and the dialect of Scotland.</p>

  <p><i>Third</i>: independently of these two sources, dialectical
  expressions have gradually grown up among our English-speaking people, as
  dialects arise everywhere.</p>

  <p>In the following pages whenever a word or a phrase is not assigned to
  any origin it is to be understood as belonging to this third
  class:&mdash;that is so far as is known at present; for I have no doubt
  that many of these will be found, after further research, to be either
  Irish-Gaelic or Old English. It is to be also observed that a good many
  of the dialectical expressions given in this book as belonging to Ireland
  may possibly be found current in England or in Scotland or in both. But
  that is no reason why they should not be included here.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Influence of Irish.</i></p>

  <p>The Irish language has influenced our Irish-English speech in several
  ways. To begin with: it <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page2"></a>{2}</span>has determined the popular pronunciation, in
  certain combinations, of three English consonants, <i>t</i>, <i>d</i>,
  and <i>th</i>, but in a way (so far as <i>t</i> and <i>d</i> are
  concerned) that would not now be followed by anyone even moderately well
  educated. The sounds of <i>English t</i> and <i>d</i> are not the same as
  those of the <i>Irish t</i> and <i>d</i>; and when the people began to
  exchange the Irish language for English, they did not quite abandon the
  Irish sounds of these two letters, but imported them into their English,
  especially <i>when they came before r</i>. That is why we hear among the
  people in every part of Ireland such vulgarisms as (for <i>t</i>)
  <i>bitther</i>, <i>butther</i>, <i>thrue</i>; and (for <i>d</i>)
  <i>laddher</i> (ladder), <i>cidher</i> (cider), <i>foddher</i>, &amp;c.
  Yet in other positions we sound these letters correctly, as in
  <i>fat</i>, <i>football</i>, <i>white</i>; <i>bad</i>, <i>hide</i>,
  <i>wild</i>, &amp;c. No one, however uneducated, will mispronounce the
  <i>t</i> and <i>d</i> in such words as these. Why it is that the
  <i>Irish</i> sound is retained before <i>r</i> and not in other
  combinations&mdash;why for instance the Irish people sound the <i>t</i>
  and <i>d</i> incorrectly in <i>platter</i> and <i>drive</i> [platther,
  dhrive] and correctly in <i>plate</i> and <i>dive</i>&mdash;is a thing I
  cannot account for.</p>

  <p>As for the English <i>th</i>, it may be said that the general run of
  the Irish people never sound it at all; for it is a very difficult sound
  to anyone excepting a born Englishman, and also excepting a small
  proportion of those born and reared on the east coast of Ireland. It has
  two varieties of sound, heard in <i>bath</i> and <i>bathe</i>: and for
  these two our people use the Irish <i>t</i> and <i>d</i>, as heard in the
  words given above.</p>

  <p>A couple of centuries ago or more the people had another substitute
  for this <i>th</i> (in <i>bathe</i>) namely <i>d</i>, which held its
  place for a considerable time, and this <!-- Page 3 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>{3}</span>sound was then considered
  almost a national characteristic; so that in the song of 'Lillibulero'
  the English author of the song puts this pronunciation all through in the
  mouth of the Irishman:&mdash;'<i>Dere</i> was an ould prophecy found in a
  bog.' It is still sometimes heard, but merely as a defect of speech of
  individuals:&mdash;'<i>De</i> books are here: <i>dat</i> one is yours and
  <i>dis</i> is mine.' Danny Mann speaks this way all through Gerald
  Griffin's 'Collegians.'</p>

  <p>There was, and to a small extent still is, a similar
  tendency&mdash;though not so decided&mdash;for the other sound of
  <i>th</i> (as in <i>bath</i>):&mdash;'I had a hot <i>bat</i> this
  morning; and I remained in it for <i>tirty</i> minutes': 'I <i>tink</i>
  it would be well for you to go home to-day.'</p>

  <p>Another influence of the Irish language is on the letter <i>s</i>. In
  Irish, this letter in certain combinations is sounded the same as the
  English <i>sh</i>; and the people often&mdash;though not always&mdash;in
  similar combinations, bring this sound into their English:&mdash;'He gave
  me a blow of his <i>fisht</i>'; 'he was <i>whishling</i> St. Patrick's
  Day'; 'Kilkenny is <i>sickshty</i> miles from this.' You hear this sound
  very often among the more uneducated of our people.</p>

  <p>In imitation of this vulgar sound of <i>s</i>, the letter <i>z</i>
  often comes in for a similar change (though there is no such sound in the
  Irish language). Here the <i>z</i> gets the sound heard in the English
  words <i>glazier</i>, <i>brazier</i>:&mdash;'He bought a <i>dozhen</i>
  eggs'; ''tis <i>drizzhling</i> rain'; 'that is <i>dizhmal</i> news.'</p>

  <p>The second way in which our English is influenced by Irish is in
  vocabulary. When our Irish forefathers began to adopt English, they
  brought with them from their native language many single Irish <!-- Page
  4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>{4}</span>words and used
  them&mdash;as best suited to express what they meant&mdash;among their
  newly acquired English words; and these words remain to this day in the
  current English of their descendants, and will I suppose remain for ever.
  And the process still goes on&mdash;though slowly&mdash;for as time
  passes, Irish words are being adopted even in the English of the best
  educated people. There is no need to give many examples here, for they
  will be found all through this book, especially in the Vocabulary. I will
  instance the single word <i>galore</i> (plentiful) which you will now
  often see in English newspapers and periodicals. The adoption of Irish
  words and phrases into English nowadays is in great measure due to the
  influence of Irishmen resident in England, who write a large
  proportion&mdash;indeed I think the largest proportion&mdash;of the
  articles in English periodicals of every kind. Other Irish words such as
  <i>shamrock</i>, <i>whiskey</i>, <i>bother</i>, <i>blarney</i>, are now
  to be found in every English Dictionary. <i>Smithereens</i> too (broken
  bits after a smash) is a grand word, and is gaining ground every day. Not
  very long ago I found it used in a public speech in London by a
  Parliamentary candidate&mdash;an Englishman; and he would hardly have
  used it unless he believed that it was fairly intelligible to his
  audience.</p>

  <p>The third way in which Irish influences our English is in idiom: that
  is, idiom borrowed from the Irish language. Of course the idioms were
  transferred about the same time as the single words of the vocabulary.
  This is by far the most interesting and important feature. Its importance
  was pointed out by me in a paper printed twenty years <!-- Page 5
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>{5}</span>ago, and it has
  been properly dwelt upon by Miss Hayden and Professor Hartog in their
  recently written joint paper mentioned in the Preface. Most of these
  idiomatic phrases are simply translations from Irish; and when the
  translations are literal, Englishmen often find it hard or impossible to
  understand them. For a phrase may be correct in Irish, but incorrect, or
  even unintelligible, in English when translated word for word. Gerald
  Griffin has preserved more of these idioms (in 'The Collegians,' 'The
  Coiner,' 'Tales of a Jury-room,' &amp;c.) than any other writer; and very
  near him come Charles Kickham (in 'Knocknagow'), Crofton Croker (in
  'Fairy Legends') and Edward Walsh. These four writers almost exhaust the
  dialect of the South of Ireland.</p>

  <p>On the other hand Carleton gives us the Northern dialect very fully,
  especially that of Tyrone and eastern Ulster; but he has very little
  idiom, the peculiarities he has preserved being chiefly in vocabulary and
  pronunciation.</p>

  <p>Mr. Seumas MacManus has in his books faithfully pictured the dialect
  of Donegal (of which he is a native) and of all north-west Ulster.</p>

  <p>In the importation of Irish idiom into English, Irish writers of the
  present day are also making their influence felt, for I often come across
  a startling Irish expression (in English words of course) in some English
  magazine article, obviously written by one of my fellow-countrymen. Here
  I ought to remark that they do this with discretion and common sense, for
  they always make sure that the Irish idiom they use is such as that any
  Englishman can understand it. <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page6"></a>{6}</span></p>

  <p>There is a special chapter (iv) in this book devoted to Anglo-Irish
  phrases imported direct from Irish; but instances will be found all
  through the book.</p>

  <p>It is safe to state that by far the greatest number of our Anglo-Irish
  idioms come from the Irish language.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Influence of Old English and of Scotch.</i></p>

  <p>From the time of the Anglo-Norman invasion, in the twelfth century,
  colonies of English and of Welsh-English people were settled in
  Ireland&mdash;chiefly in the eastern part&mdash;and they became
  particularly numerous in the time of Elizabeth, three or four centuries
  ago, when they were spread all over the country. When these Elizabethan
  colonists, who were nearly all English, settled down and made friends
  with the natives and intermarried with them, great numbers of them
  learned to use the Irish language; while the natives on their part
  learned English from the newcomers. There was give and take in every
  place where the two peoples and the two languages mixed. And so the
  native Irish people learned to speak Elizabethan English&mdash;the very
  language used by Shakespeare; and in a very considerable degree the old
  Gaelic people and those of English descent retain it to this day. For our
  people are very conservative in retaining old customs and forms of
  speech. Many words accordingly that are discarded as
  old-fashioned&mdash;or dead and gone&mdash;in England, are still
  flourishing&mdash;alive and well&mdash;in Ireland. They are now regarded
  as vulgarisms by the educated&mdash;which no doubt they are&mdash;but
  they are vulgarisms of respectable origin, <!-- Page 7 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>{7}</span>representing as they do the
  classical English of Shakespeare's time.</p>

  <p>Instances of this will be found all through the book; but I may here
  give a passing glance at such pronunciations as <i>tay</i> for
  <i>tea</i>, <i>sevare</i> for <i>severe</i>, <i>desaive</i> for
  <i>deceive</i>; and such words as <i>sliver</i>, <i>lief</i>,
  <i>afeard</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;all of which will be found mentioned farther
  on in this book. It may be said that hardly any of those incorrect forms
  of speech, now called vulgarisms, used by our people, were invented by
  them; they are nearly all survivals of usages that in former times were
  correct&mdash;in either English or Irish.</p>

  <p>In the reign of James I.&mdash;three centuries ago&mdash;a large part
  of Ulster&mdash;nearly all the fertile land of six of the nine
  counties&mdash;was handed over to new settlers, chiefly Presbyterians
  from Scotland, the old Catholic owners being turned off. These settlers
  of course brought with them their Scotch dialect, which remains almost in
  its purity among their descendants to this day. This dialect, it must be
  observed, is confined to Ulster, while the remnants of the Elizabethan
  English are spread all over Ireland.</p>

  <p>As to the third main source&mdash;the gradual growth of dialect among
  our English-speaking people&mdash;it is not necessary to make any special
  observations about it here; as it will be found illustrated all through
  the book.</p>

  <p>Owing to these three influences, we speak in Ireland a very distinct
  dialect of English, which every educated and observant Englishman
  perceives the moment he sets foot in this country. It is most marked
  among our peasantry; but in fact none of us are free from it, no matter
  how well educated. <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page8"></a>{8}</span>This does not mean that we speak bad English;
  for it is generally admitted that our people on the whole, including the
  peasantry, speak better English&mdash;nearer to the literary
  standard&mdash;than the corresponding classes of England. This arises
  mainly&mdash;so far as we are concerned&mdash;from the fact that for the
  last four or five generations we have learned our English in a large
  degree from books, chiefly through the schools.</p>

  <p>So far as our dialectical expressions are vulgar or unintelligible,
  those who are educated among us ought of course to avoid them. But
  outside this a large proportion of our peculiar words and phrases are
  vivid and picturesque, and when used with discretion and at the right
  time, give a sparkle to our conversation; so that I see no reason why we
  should wipe them out completely from our speech so as to hide our
  nationality. To be hypercritical here is often absurd and sometimes
  silly.</p>

  <p>I well remember on one occasion when I was young in literature
  perpetrating a pretty strong Hibernicism in one of my books. It was not
  forbidding, but rather bright and expressive: and it passed off, and
  still passes off very well, for the book is still to the fore. Some days
  after the publication, a lady friend who was somewhat of a pedant and
  purist in the English language, came to me with a look of grave
  concern&mdash;so solemn indeed that it somewhat disconcerted me&mdash;to
  direct my attention to the error. Her manner was absurdly exaggerated
  considering the occasion. Judging from the serious face and the voice of
  bated breath, you might almost imagine that I had committed a secret
  murder and <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page9"></a>{9}</span>that she had come to inform me that the corpse
  had just been found.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">AFFIRMING, ASSENTING, AND SALUTING.</p>

  <p>The various Irish modes of affirming, denying, &amp;c., will be
  understood from the examples given in this short chapter better than from
  any general observations.</p>

  <p>The Irish <i>ní'l lá fós é</i> [neel law fo-say: it isn't day yet] is
  often used for emphasis in asseveration, even when persons are speaking
  English; but in this case the saying is often turned into English. 'If
  the master didn't give Tim a tongue-dressing, <i>'tisn't day yet</i>'
  (which would be said either by day or by night): meaning he gave him a
  very severe scolding. 'When I saw the mad dog running at me, if I didn't
  get a fright, <i>neel-law-fo-say</i>.'</p>

  <p>'I went to town yesterday in all the rain, and if I didn't get a
  wetting <i>there isn't a cottoner in Cork</i>': meaning I got a very
  great wetting. This saying is very common in Munster; and workers in
  cotton were numerous in Cork when it was invented.</p>

  <p>A very usual emphatic ending to an assertion is seen in the
  following:&mdash;'That horse is a splendid animal <i>and no
  mistake</i>.'</p>

  <p>'<i>I'll engage</i> you visited Peggy when you were in town': i.e. I
  assert it without much fear of contradiction: I warrant. Much in the same
  sense we use <i>I'll go bail</i>:&mdash;'I'll go bail you never got that
  <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page10"></a>{10}</span>money you lent to Tom': 'An illigant song he
  could sing I'll go bail' (Lever): 'You didn't meet your linnet (i.e. your
  girl&mdash;your sweetheart) this evening I'll go bail' (Robert Dwyer
  Joyce in 'The Beauty of the Blossom Gate').</p>

  <p>'I'll hold you' introduces an assertion with some emphasis: it is
  really elliptical: I'll hold you [a wager: but always a fictitious
  wager]. I'll hold you I'll finish that job by one o'clock, i.e. I'll
  warrant I will&mdash;you may take it from me that I will.</p>

  <p>The phrase 'if you go to that of it' is often added on to a statement
  to give great emphasis, amounting almost to a sort of defiance of
  contradiction or opposition. 'I don't believe you could walk four miles
  an hour': 'Oh don't you: I could then, or five if you go to that of it':
  'I don't believe that Joe Lee is half as good a hurler as his brother
  Phil.' 'I can tell you he is then, and a great deal better if you go to
  that of it.' Lowry Looby, speaking of St. Swithin, says:&mdash;'He was
  then, buried more than once if you go to that of it.' (Gerald Griffin:
  'Collegians': Munster.)</p>

  <p>'Is it cold outside doors?' Reply, 'Aye is it,' meaning 'it is
  certainly.' An emphatic assertion (after the Gaelic construction)
  frequently heard is 'Ah then, 'tis I that wouldn't like to be in that
  fight.' 'Ah 'tis my mother that will be delighted.'</p>

  <p>'What did he do to you?' 'He hit me with his stick, <i>so he did</i>,
  and it is a great shame, so it is.' 'I like a cup of tea at night, so I
  do.' In the South an expression of this kind is very often added on as a
  sort of clincher to give emphasis. Similar are the very usual endings as
  seen in these <!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page11"></a>{11}</span>assertions:&mdash;'He is a great old
  schemer, <i>that's what he is</i>': 'I spoke up to the master and showed
  him he was wrong&mdash;<i>I did begob</i>.'</p>

  <p>I asked a man one day: 'Well, how is the young doctor going on in his
  new place?' and he replied 'Ah, how but well'; which he meant to be very
  emphatic: and then he went on to give particulars.</p>

  <p>A strong denial is often expressed in the following way: 'This day
  will surely be wet, so don't forget your umbrella': 'What a fool I am':
  as much as to say, 'I should be a fool indeed to go without an umbrella
  to-day, and I think there's no mark of a fool about me.' 'Now Mary don't
  wait for the last train [from Howth] for there will be an awful crush.'
  'What a fool I'd be ma'am.' 'Oh Mr. Lory I thought you were gone home
  [from the dance] two hours ago': 'What a fool I am,' replies Lory
  ('Knocknagow'), equivalent to 'I hadn't the least notion of making such a
  fool of myself while there's such fun here.' This is heard everywhere in
  Ireland, 'from the centre all round to the sea.'</p>

  <p>Much akin to this is Nelly Donovan's reply to Billy Heffernan who had
  made some flattering remark to her:&mdash;'Arrah now Billy what sign of a
  fool do you see on me?' ('Knocknagow.')</p>

  <p>An emphatic assertion or assent: 'Yesterday was very wet.'
  Reply:&mdash;'You may say it was,' or 'you may well say that.'</p>

  <p>'I'm greatly afeard he'll try to injure me.' Answer:&mdash;''Tis fear
  <i>for</i> you' (emphasis on <i>for</i>), meaning 'you have good reason
  to be afeard': merely a translation of the Irish <i>is eagal duitse</i>.
  <!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page12"></a>{12}</span></p>

  <p>'Oh I'll pay you what I owe you.' ''Tis a pity you wouldn't indeed,'
  says the other, a satirical reply, meaning 'of course you will and no
  thanks to you for that; who'd expect otherwise?'</p>

  <p>'I am going to the fair to-morrow, as I want to buy a couple of cows.'
  Reply, 'I know,' as much as to say 'I see,' 'I understand.' This is one
  of our commonest terms of assent.</p>

  <p>An assertion or statement introduced by the words 'to tell God's
  truth' is always understood to be weighty and somewhat unexpected, the
  introductory words being given as a guarantee of its truth:&mdash;'Have
  you the rest of the money you owe me ready now James?' 'Well to tell
  God's truth I was not able to make it all up, but I can give you £5.'</p>

  <p>Another guarantee of the same kind, though not quite so solemn, is 'my
  hand to you,' or 'I give you my hand and word.' 'My hand to you I'll
  never rest till the job is finished.' 'Come and hunt with me in the wood,
  and my hand to you we shall soon have enough of victuals for both of us.'
  (Clarence Mangan in Ir. Pen. Journ.)</p>

  <p>'Do you know your Catechism?' Answer, 'What would ail me not to know
  it?' meaning 'of course I do&mdash;'twould be a strange thing if I
  didn't.' 'Do you think you can make that lock all right?' 'Ah what would
  ail me,' i.e., 'no doubt I can&mdash;of course I can; if I couldn't do
  that it would be a sure sign <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page13"></a>{13}</span>that something was amiss with me&mdash;that
  something ailed me.'</p>

  <p>'Believe Tom and who'll believe you': a way of saying that Tom is not
  telling truth.</p>

  <p>An emphatic 'yes' to a statement is often expressed in the following
  way:&mdash;'This is a real wet day.' Answer, 'I believe you.' 'I think
  you made a good bargain with Tim about that field.' 'I believe you I
  did.'</p>

  <p>A person who is offered anything he is very willing to take, or asked
  to do anything he is anxious to do, often answers in this
  way:&mdash;'James, would you take a glass of punch?' or 'Tom, will you
  dance with my sister in the next round?' In either case the answer is,
  'Would a duck swim?'</p>

  <p>A weak sort of assent is often expressed in this way:&mdash;'Will you
  bring Nelly's book to her when you are going home, Dan?' Answer, 'I don't
  mind,' or 'I don't mind if I do.'</p>

  <p>To express unbelief in a statement or disbelief in the usefulness or
  effectiveness of any particular line of action, a person says 'that's all
  in my eye,' or ''Tis all in my eye, Betty Martin&mdash;O'; but this last
  is regarded as slang.</p>

  <p>Sometimes an unusual or unexpected statement is introduced in the
  following manner, the introductory words being usually spoken
  quickly:&mdash;'<i>Now do you know what I'm going to tell
  you</i>&mdash;that ragged old chap has £200 in the bank.' In Derry they
  make it&mdash;'Now listen to what I'm going to say.'</p>

  <p>In some parts of the South and West and Northwest, servants and others
  have a way of replying to directions that at first sounds strange or even
  <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page14"></a>{14}</span>disrespectful:&mdash;'Biddy, go up please to
  the drawing-room and bring me down the needle and thread and stocking you
  will find on the table.' 'That will do ma'am,' replies Biddy, and off she
  goes and brings them. But this is their way of saying 'yes ma'am,' or
  'Very well ma'am.'</p>

  <p>So also you say to the hotel-keeper:&mdash;'Can I have breakfast
  please to-morrow morning at 7 o'clock?' 'That will do sir.' This reply in
  fact expresses the greatest respect, as much as to say, 'A word from you
  is quite enough.'</p>

  <p>'I caught the thief at my potatoes.' 'No, but did you?' i.e., is it
  possible you did so? A very common exclamation, especially in Ulster.</p>

  <p>'Oh man' is a common exclamation to render an assertion more emphatic,
  and sometimes to express surprise:&mdash;'Oh man, you never saw such a
  fine race as we had.' In Ulster they duplicate it, with still the same
  application:&mdash;'Oh man-o-man that's great rain.' 'Well John you'd
  hardly believe it, but I got £50 for my horse to-day at the fair.' Reply,
  'Oh man that's a fine price.'</p>

  <p>'Never fear' is heard constantly in many parts of Ireland as an
  expression of assurance:&mdash;'Now James don't forget the sugar.' 'Never
  fear ma'am.' 'Ah never fear there will be plenty flowers in that garden
  this year.' 'You will remember to have breakfast ready at 7 o'clock.'
  'Never fear sir,' meaning 'making your mind easy on the point&mdash;it
  will be all right.' <i>Never fear</i> is merely a translation of the
  equally common Irish phrase, <i>ná bí heagal ort</i>.</p>

  <p>Most of our ordinary salutations are translations from Irish. <i>Go
  m-beannuighe Dia dhuit</i> is literally <!-- Page 15 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>{15}</span>'May God bless you,' or
  'God bless you' which is a usual salutation in English. The commonest of
  all our salutes is 'God save you,' or (for a person entering a house)
  'God save all here'; and the response is 'God save you kindly'
  ('Knocknagow'); where <i>kindly</i> means 'of a like kind,' 'in like
  manner,' 'similarly.' Another but less usual response to the same
  salutation is, 'And you too,' which is appropriate. ('Knocknagow.') 'God
  save all here' is used all over Ireland except in the extreme North,
  where it is hardly understood.</p>

  <p>To the ordinary salutation, 'Good-morrow,' which is heard everywhere,
  the usual response is 'Good-morrow kindly.' 'Morrow Wat,' said Mr. Lloyd.
  'Morrow kindly,' replied Wat. ('Knocknagow.') 'The top of the morning to
  you' is used everywhere, North and South.</p>

  <p>In some places if a woman throws out water at night at the kitchen
  door, she says first, 'Beware of the water,' lest the 'good people' might
  happen to be passing at the time, and one or more of them might get
  splashed.</p>

  <p>A visitor coming in and finding the family at dinner:&mdash;'Much good
  may it do you.'</p>

  <p>In very old times it was a custom for workmen on completing any work
  and delivering it finished to give it their blessing. This blessing was
  called <i>abarta</i> (an old word, not used in modern Irish), and if it
  was omitted the workman was subject to a fine to be deducted from his
  hire equal to the seventh part of the cost of his feeding. (<i>Senchus
  Mór</i> and 'Cormac's Glossary.') It was especially incumbent on women to
  bless the work of other women. This custom, which is more than a thousand
  years old, has <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page16"></a>{16}</span>descended to our day; for the people on
  coming up to persons engaged in work of any kind always say 'God bless
  your work,' or its equivalent original in Irish, <i>Go m-beannuighe Dia
  air bhur n-obair</i>. (See my 'Social History of Ancient Ireland,' <span
  class="scac">II.</span>, page 324.)</p>

  <p>In modern times tradesmen have perverted this pleasing custom into a
  new channel not so praise-worthy. On the completion of any work, such as
  a building, they fix a pole with a flag on the highest point to ask the
  employer for his <i>blessing</i>, which means money for a drink.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">ASSERTION BY NEGATIVE OF OPPOSITE.</p>

  <p>Assertions are often made by using the negative of the opposite
  assertion. 'You must be hungry now Tom, and this little rasher will do
  you no harm,' meaning it will do you good. An old man has tired himself
  dancing and says:&mdash;'A glass of whiskey will do us no harm after
  that.' (Carleton.) A lady occupying a furnished house at the seaside near
  Dublin said to the boy who had charge of the premises:&mdash;'There may
  be burglars about here; wouldn't it be well for you to come and close the
  basement shutters at night?' 'Why then begob ma'am <i>'twould be no
  har-um</i>.' Here is a bit of rustic information (from Limerick) that
  might be useful to food experts:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Rye bread will do you good,</p>

    </div>

<p><!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"></a>{17}</span></p>

  <p>This curious way of speaking, which is very general among all classes
  of people in Ireland and in every part of the country, is often used in
  the Irish language, from which we have imported it into our English. Here
  are a few Irish examples; but they might be multiplied indefinitely, and
  some others will be found through this chapter. In the Irish tale called
  'The Battle of Gavra,' the narrator says:&mdash;[The enemy slew a large
  company of our army] 'and that was no great help to us.' In 'The
  Colloquy,' a piece much older than 'The Battle of Gavra,' Kylta, wishing
  to tell his audience that when the circumstance he is relating occurred
  he was very young, expresses it by saying [at that time] 'I myself was
  not old.'</p>

  <p>One night a poet was grossly insulted: 'On the morrow he rose and he
  was not thankful.' (From the very old Irish tale called 'The Second
  Battle of Moytura': Rev. Celt.)</p>

  <p>Another old Irish writer, telling us that a certain company of
  soldiers is well out of view, expresses it in this way:&mdash;<i>Ní fhuil
  in cuire gan chleith</i>, literally, 'the company is not without
  concealment.'</p>

  <p>How closely these and other old models are imitated in our English
  will be seen from the following examples from every part of
  Ireland:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'I can tell you Paddy Walsh is no chicken now,' meaning he is very
  old. The same would be said of an old maid:&mdash;'She's no chicken,'
  meaning that she is old for a girl.</p>

  <p>'How are your potato gardens going on this year?' 'Why then they're
  not too good'; i.e. only middling or bad.</p>

  <p>A usual remark among us conveying mild approval <!-- Page 18 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>{18}</span>is 'that's not bad.' A
  Dublin boy asked me one day:&mdash;'Maybe you wouldn't have e'er a penny
  that you'd give me, sir?' i.e., 'Have you a penny to give me?' 'You
  wouldn't like to have a cup of tea, would you?' An invitation, but not a
  cordial one. This is a case of '<i>will you</i> was never a good fellow'
  (for which see Vocabulary).</p>

  <p>'No joke' is often used in the sense of 'very serious.' 'It was no
  joke to be caught in our boat in such a storm as that.' 'The loss of £10
  is no joke for that poor widow.'</p>

  many a dry eye after him.' (Kildare.)</p>

  <p>'Did Tom do your work as satisfactorily as Davy?' 'Oh, it isn't

  <p>'There's a man outside wants to see you, sir,' says Charlie, our
  office attendant, a typical southern Irishman. 'What kind is he Charlie?
  does he look like a fellow wanting money?' Instead of a direct
  affirmative, Charlie answers, 'Why then sir I don't think he'll give you
  much anyway.'</p>

  <p>'Are people buried there now?' I asked of a man regarding an old
  graveyard near Blessington in Wicklow. Instead of answering 'very few,'
  he replied: 'Why then not too many sir.'</p>

  <p>When the roads are dirty&mdash;deep in mire&mdash;'there's fine

  <p>'It wouldn't be wishing you a pound note to do so and so': i.e. 'it

  Often used as a sort of threat to deter a person from doing it.</p>

  <p>'Where do you keep all your money?' 'Oh, indeed, <i>it's not much I
  have</i>': merely translated from the Gaelic, <i>Ní mórán atâ

  outside your head.'</p>

  <p>'The only sure way to conceal evil is not to do it.'</p>

  <p>'I don't think very much of these horses,' meaning 'I have a low
  opinion of them.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't pretend to understand what he said,' appears a negative
  statement; but it is really one of our ways of making a positive
  one:&mdash;'I pretended not to understand him.' To the same class belongs
  the common expression 'I don't think':&mdash;'I don't think you bought
  that horse too dear,' meaning 'I think you did not buy him too dear'; 'I
  don't think this day will be wet,' equivalent to 'I think it will not be
  wet.' <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  Another way of expressing the same idea often heard:&mdash;'He's no sop

  <p>'It was not too wise of you to buy those cows as the market stands at

  <p>'You had no right to take that book without my leave'; meaning 'You
  were wrong in taking it&mdash;it was wrong of you to take it.' A
  translation of the Irish <i>ní cóir duit</i>. 'A bad right' is stronger
  than 'no right.' 'You have no right to speak ill of my uncle' is simply
  negation:&mdash;'You are wrong, for you have no reason or occasion to
  speak so.' 'A bad right you have to speak ill of my uncle:' that is to
  say, 'You are doubly wrong' [for he once did you a great service]. 'A bad
  right anyone would have to call Ned a screw' [for he is well known for
  his generosity]. ('Knocknagow.') Another way of applying the
  word&mdash;in the sense of <i>duty</i>&mdash;is seen in the
  following:&mdash;A member at an Urban Council <!-- Page 22 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>{22}</span>meeting makes an
  offensive remark and refuses to withdraw it: when another
  retorts:&mdash;'You have a right to withdraw it'&mdash;i.e. 'it is your
  duty.' So:&mdash;'You have a right to pay your debts.'</p>

  <p>'Is your present farm as large as the one you left?'
  Reply:&mdash;'Well indeed it doesn't want much of it.' A common
  expression, and borrowed from the Irish, where it is still more usual.
  The Irish <i>beagnach</i> ('little but') and <i>acht ma beag</i> ('but
  only a little') are both used in the above sense ('doesn't want much'),
  equivalent to the English <i>almost</i>.</p>

  <p>A person is asked did he ever see a ghost. If his reply is to be
  negative, the invariable way of expressing it is: 'I never saw anything
  worse than myself, thanks be to God.'</p>

  <p>A person is grumbling without cause, making out that he is struggling
  in some difficulty&mdash;such as poverty&mdash;and the people will say to
  him ironically: 'Oh how bad you are.' A universal Irish phrase among high
  and low.</p>

  <p>A person gives a really good present to a girl:&mdash;'He didn't
  affront her by that present.' (Patterson: Antrim and Down.)</p>

  <p>How we cling to this form of expression&mdash;or rather how it clings
  to us&mdash;is seen in the following extract from the Dublin
  correspondence of one of the London newspapers of December,
  1909:&mdash;'Mr. &mdash;&mdash; is not expected to be returned to
  parliament at the general election'; meaning it <i>is</i> expected that
  he will <i>not</i> be returned. So also:&mdash;'How is poor Jack Fox
  to-day?' 'Oh he's not expected'; i.e. not expected to live,&mdash;he is
  <i>given over</i>. This expression, <i>not expected</i>, is a very common
  Irish phrase in cases of death sickness. <!-- Page 23 --><span

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">IDIOMS DERIVED FROM THE IRISH LANGUAGE.</p>

  <p>In this chapter I am obliged to quote the original Irish passages a
  good deal as a guarantee of authenticity for the satisfaction of Irish
  scholars: but for those who have no Irish the translations will answer
  equally well. Besides the examples I have brought together here, many
  others will be found all through the book. I have already remarked that
  the great majority of our idiomatic Hibernian-English sayings are derived
  from the Irish language.</p>

  <p>When existence or modes of existence are predicated in Irish by the
  verb <i>tá</i> or <i>atá</i> (English <i>is</i>), the Irish preposition
  <i>in</i> (English <i>in</i>) in some of its forms is always used, often
  with a possessive pronoun, which gives rise to a very curious idiom.
  Thus, 'he is a mason' is in Irish <i>tá sé 'n a shaor</i>, which is
  literally <i>he is in his mason</i>: 'I am standing' is <i>tá mé a m'
  sheasamh</i>, lit. <i>I am in my standing</i>. This explains the common
  Anglo-Irish form of expression:&mdash;'He fell on the road out of his
  standing': for as he is 'in his standing' (according to the Irish) when
  he is standing up, he is 'out of his standing' when he falls. This idiom
  with <i>in</i> is constantly translated literally into English by the
  Irish people. Thus, instead of saying, 'I sent the wheat thrashed into
  corn to the mill, and it came home as flour,' they will rather say, 'I
  sent the wheat <i>in corn</i> to the mill, and it came home <i>in
  flour</i>.' Here the <i>in</i> denotes identity: 'Your <!-- Page 24
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>{24}</span>hair is in a
  wisp'; i.e. it <i>is</i> a wisp: 'My eye is in whey in my head,' i.e. it
  <i>is</i> whey. (John Keegan in Ir. Pen. Journ.)</p>

  <p>But an idiom closely resembling this, and in some respects identical
  with it, exists in English (though it has not been hitherto
  noticed&mdash;so far as I am aware)&mdash;as may be seen from the
  following examples:&mdash;'The Shannon ... rushed through Athlone
  <i>in</i> a deep and rapid stream (Macaulay), i.e. it <i>was</i> a deep
  and rapid stream (like our expression 'Your handkerchief is in
  ribbons').</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Where heaves the turf <i>in</i> many a mouldering heap.'</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>(<span class="sc">Gray's</span> 'Elegy.')</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Hence bards, like Proteus, long in vain tied down,</p>
      <p>Escape <i>in</i> monsters and amaze the town.'</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>(<span class="sc">Pope</span>: 'Dunciad.')</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>'The bars forming the front and rear edges of each plane [of the
  flying-machine] are always <i>in</i> one piece' (Daily Mail). Shelley's
  'Cloud' says, 'I laugh <i>in</i> thunder' (meaning I laugh, and my laugh
  <i>is</i> thunder.) 'The greensand and chalk were continued across the
  weald <i>in</i> a great dome.' (Lord Avebury.)</p>

  <p>'Just to the right of him were the white-robed bishops <i>in a
  group</i>.' (Daily Mail.) 'And men <i>in</i> nations' (Byron in 'The
  Isles of Greece'): 'The people came <i>in</i> tens and twenties': 'the
  rain came down <i>in</i> torrents': 'I'll take £10 <i>in</i> gold and the
  rest <i>in</i> silver': 'the snow gathered <i>in</i> a heap.' 'The money
  came [home] sometimes <i>in</i> specie and sometimes <i>in</i> goods'
  (Lord Rothschild, speech in House of Lords, 29th November, 1909), exactly
  like 'the corn came home <i>in</i> flour,' quoted above. The <!-- Page 25
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>{25}</span>preceding
  examples do not quite fully represent the Irish idiom in its entirety,
  inasmuch as the possessive pronouns are absent. But even these are
  sometimes found, as in the familiar phrases, 'the people came <i>in
  their</i> hundreds.' 'You are <i>in your</i> thousands' [here at the
  meeting], which is an exact reproduction of the Gaelic phrase in the
  Irish classical story:&mdash;<i>Atá sibh in bhur n-ealaibh</i>, 'Ye are
  swans' (lit. 'Ye are in your swans').</p>

  <p>When mere existence is predicated, the Gaelic <i>ann</i> (<i>in
  it</i>, i.e. 'in existence') is used, as <i>atá sneachta ann</i>, 'there
  is snow'; lit. 'there is snow <i>there</i>,' or 'there is snow <i>in
  it</i>,' i.e. in existence. The <i>ann</i> should be left blank in
  English translation, i.e. having no proper representative. But our people
  will not let it go waste; they bring it into their English in the form of
  either <i>in it</i> or <i>there</i>, both of which in this construction
  carry the meaning of <i>in existence</i>. Mrs. Donovan says to Bessy
  Morris:&mdash;'Is it yourself that's <i>in it</i>?' ('Knocknagow'), which
  would stand in correct Irish <i>An tusa atá ann</i>? On a Sunday one man
  insults and laughs at another, who says, 'Only for the day that's <i>in
  it</i> I'd make you laugh at the wrong side of your mouth': 'the weather
  that's <i>in it</i> is very hot.' 'There's nothing at all <i>there</i>
  (in existence) as it used to be' (Gerald Griffin: 'Collegians'): 'this
  day is bad for growth, there's a sharp east wind <i>there</i>.'</p>

  <p>I do not find this use of the English preposition
  <i>in</i>&mdash;namely, to denote identity&mdash;referred to in English
  dictionaries, though it ought to be.</p>

  <p>The same mode of expressing existence by <i>an</i> or <i>in</i> is
  found in the Ulster and Scotch phrase for <!-- Page 26 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>{26}</span><i>to be alone</i>, which
  is as follows, always bringing in the personal pronoun:&mdash;'I am in my
  lone,' 'he is in his lone,' 'they are in their lone'; or more commonly
  omitting the preposition (though it is always understood): 'She is living
  her lone.' All these expressions are merely translations from Gaelic, in
  which they are constantly used; 'I am in my lone' being from <i>Tá me am'
  aonar</i>, where <i>am'</i> is 'in my' and <i>aonar</i>, 'lone.' <i>Am'
  aonar seal do bhiossa</i>, 'Once as I was alone.' (Old Irish Song.) In
  north-west Ulster they sometimes use the preposition <i>by</i>:&mdash;'To
  come home by his lone' (Seumas Mac Manus). Observe the word <i>lone</i>
  is always made <i>lane</i> in Scotland, and generally in Ulster; and
  these expressions or their like will be found everywhere in Burns or in
  any other Scotch (or Ulster) dialect writer.</p>

  <p>Prepositions are used in Irish where it might be wrong to use them in
  corresponding constructions in English. Yet the Irish phrases are
  continually translated literally, which gives rise to many incorrect
  dialect expressions. Of this many examples will be found in what
  follows.</p>

  <p>'He put lies <i>on</i> me'; a form of expression often heard. This
  might have one or the other of two meanings, viz. either 'he accused me
  of telling lies,' or 'he told lies about me.'</p>

  <p>'The tinker took fourpence <i>out of</i> that kettle,' i.e. he earned
  4<i>d</i>. by mending it. St. Patrick left his name <i>on</i> the
  townland of Kilpatrick: that nickname remained <i>on</i> Dan Ryan ever
  since.</p>

  <p>'He was vexed <i>to</i> me' (i.e. with me): 'I was <i>at him</i> for
  half a year' (with him); 'You could find no fault <i>to it</i>' (with
  it). All these are in use. <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page27"></a>{27}</span></p>

  <p>'I took the medicine according to the doctor's order, but I found
  myself nothing the better <i>of it</i>.' 'You have a good time <i>of
  it</i>.' I find in Dickens however (in his own words) that the wind 'was
  obviously determined to make a night <i>of it</i>.' (See p. <a
  href="#page10">10</a> for a peculiarly Irish use of <i>of it</i>.)</p>

  <p>In the Irish poem <i>Bean na d-Tri m-Bo</i>, 'The Woman of Three
  Cows,' occurs the expression, <i>As do bhólacht ná bí teann</i>, 'Do not
  be haughty <i>out of</i> your cattle.' This is a form of expression
  constantly heard in English:&mdash;'he is as proud as a peacock <i>out
  of</i> his rich relations.' So also, 'She has great thought <i>out of</i>
  him,' i.e. She has a very good opinion of him. (Queen's Co.)</p>

  <p>'I am without a penny,' i.e. I haven't a penny: very common: a
  translation from the equally common Irish expression, <i>tá me gan
  pinghín</i>.</p>

  <p>In an Irish love song the young man tells us that he had been vainly
  trying to win over the colleen <i>le bliadhain agus le lá</i>, which
  Petrie correctly (but not literally) translates 'for a year and for a
  day.' As the Irish preposition <i>le</i> signifies <i>with</i>, the
  literal translation would be '<i>with</i> a year and <i>with</i> a day,'
  which would be incorrect English. Yet the uneducated people of the South
  and West often adopt this translation; so that you will hear such
  expressions as 'I lived in Cork <i>with</i> three years.'</p>

  <p>There is an idiomatic use of the Irish preposition <i>air</i>, 'on,'
  before a personal pronoun or before a personal name and after an active
  verb, to intimate injury or disadvantage of some kind, a violation of
  right or claim. Thus, <i>Do bhuail Seumas mo ghadhar orm</i> [where
  <i>orm</i> is <i>air me</i>], 'James struck my dog <!-- Page 28 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>{28}</span><i>on me</i>,' where
  <i>on me</i> means to my detriment, in violation of my right, &amp;c.
  <i>Chaill sé mo sgian orm</i>; 'he lost my knife <i>on me</i>.'</p>

  <p>This mode of expression exists in the oldest Irish as well as in the
  colloquial languages&mdash;both Irish and English&mdash;of the present
  day. When St. Patrick was spending the Lent on Croagh Patrick the demons
  came to torment him in the shape of great black hateful-looking birds:
  and the Tripartite Life, composed (in the Irish language) in the tenth
  century, says, 'The mountain was filled with great sooty-black birds
  <i>on him</i>' (to his torment or detriment). In 'The Battle of
  Rossnaree,' Carbery, directing his men how to act against Conor, his
  enemy, tells them to send some of their heroes <i>re tuargain a sgéithe
  ar Conchobar</i>, 'to smite Conor's shield <i>on him</i>.' The King of
  Ulster is in a certain hostel, and when his enemies hear of it, they
  say:&mdash;'We are pleased at that for we shall [attack and] take the
  hostel <i>on him</i> to-night.' (Congal Claringneach.) It occurs also in
  the <i>Amra</i> of Columkille&mdash;the oldest of all&mdash;though I
  cannot lay my hand on the passage.</p>

  <p>This is one of the commonest of our Anglo-Irish idioms, so that a few
  examples will be sufficient.</p>

  <p>I once heard a grandmother&mdash;an educated Dublin lady&mdash;say, in
  a charmingly petting way, to her little grandchild who came up
  crying:&mdash;'What did they do to you on me&mdash;did they beat you on
  me?'</p>

  <p>The Irish preposition <i>ag</i>&mdash;commonly translated 'for' in
  this connexion&mdash;is used in a sense much like <i>air</i>, viz. to
  carry an idea of some sort of injury <!-- Page 29 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>{29}</span>to the person represented
  by the noun or pronoun. Typical examples are: one fellow threatening
  another says, 'I'll break your head <i>for you</i>': or 'I'll soon
  <i>settle his hash for him</i>.' This of course also comes from Irish;
  <i>Gur scoilt an plaosg aige</i>, 'so that he broke his skull <i>for
  him</i>' (Battle of Gavra); <i>Do ghearr a reim aige beo</i>, 'he
  shortened his career for him.' ('The Amadán Mór.') See 'On' in
  Vocabulary.</p>

  <p>There is still another peculiar usage of the English preposition
  <i>for</i>, which is imitated or translated from the Irish, the
  corresponding Irish preposition here being <i>mar</i>. In this case the
  prepositional phrase is added on, not to denote injury, but to express
  some sort of mild depreciation:&mdash;'Well, how is your new horse
  getting on?' 'Ah, I'm tired of him <i>for a horse</i>: he is little
  good.' A dog keeps up a continuous barking, and a person says
  impatiently, 'Ah, choke you <i>for a dog</i>' (may you be choked). Lowry
  Looby, who has been appointed to a place and is asked how he is going on
  with it, replies, 'To lose it I did <i>for a place</i>.' ('Collegians.')
  In the Irish story of <i>Bodach an Chota Lachtna</i> ('The Clown with the
  Grey Coat'), the Bodach offers Ironbones some bones to pick, on which
  Ironbones flies into a passion; and Mangan, the translator, happily puts
  into the mouth of the Bodach:&mdash;'Oh, very well, then we will not have
  any more words about them, <i>for bones</i>.' Osheen, talking in a
  querulous mood about all his companions&mdash;the Fena&mdash;having left
  him, says, [were I in my former condition] <i>Ni ghoirfinn go bráth
  orruibh, mar Fheinn</i>, 'I would never call on you, <i>for Fena</i>.'
  This last and its like are the models on which the Anglo-Irish phrases
  are formed. <!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page30"></a>{30}</span></p>

  <p>'Of you' (where <i>of</i> is not intended for <i>off</i>) is very
  frequently used in the sense of <i>from you</i>: 'I'll take the stick
  <i>of you</i> whether you like it or not.' 'Of you' is here simply a
  translation of the Irish <i>díot</i>, which is always used in this
  connexion in Irish: <i>bainfead díot é</i>, 'I will take it of you.' In
  Irish phrases like this the Irish <i>uait</i> ('from you') is not used;
  if it were the people would say 'I'll take it <i>from you</i>,' not <i>of
  you</i>. (Russell.)</p>

  <p>'Oh that news was <i>on</i> the paper yesterday.' 'I went <i>on</i>
  the train to Kingstown.' Both these are often heard in Dublin and
  elsewhere. Correct speakers generally use <i>in</i> in such cases.
  (Father Higgins and Kinahan.)</p>

  <p>In some parts of Ulster they use the preposition <i>on</i> after <i>to
  be married</i>:&mdash;'After Peggy M&lsquo;Cue had been married <i>on</i>
  Long Micky Diver' (Sheumas MacManus).</p>

  <p>'To make a speech <i>takes a good deal out of me</i>,' i.e. tires me,
  exhausts me, an expression heard very often among all classes. The phrase
  in italics is merely the translation of a very common Irish expression,
  <i>baineann sé rud éigin asam</i>, it takes something out of me.</p>

  <p>'I am afraid of her,' 'I am frightened at her,' are both correct
  English, meaning 'she has frightened me': and both are expressed in
  Donegal by 'I am afeard <i>for</i> her,' 'I am frightened <i>for</i>
  her,' where in both cases <i>for</i> is used in the sense of 'on account
  of.'</p>

  <p>In Irish any sickness, such as fever, is said to be <i>on</i> a
  person, and this idiom is imported into English. If a person wishes to
  ask 'What ails you?' he often <!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page31"></a>{31}</span>gives it the form of 'What is on you?'
  (Ulster), which is exactly the English of <i>Cad é sin ort</i>?</p>

  <p>A visitor stands up to go. 'What hurry is on you?' A mild invitation
  to stay on (Armagh). In the South, 'What hurry are you in?'</p>

  <p>She had <i>a nose on her</i>, i.e. looked sour, out of humour
  ('Knocknagow'). Much used in the South. 'They never asked me had I a
  mouth on me': universally understood and often used in Ireland, and
  meaning 'they never offered me anything to eat or drink.'</p>

  <p>I find Mark Twain using the same idiom:&mdash;[an old horse] 'had a
  neck <i>on him</i> like a bowsprit' ('Innocents Abroad'); but here I
  think Mark shows a touch of the Gaelic brush, wherever he got it.</p>

  <p>'I tried to knock another shilling out of him, but all in vain': i.e.
  I tried to persuade him to give me another shilling. This is very common
  with Irish-English speakers, and is a word for word translation of the
  equally common Irish phrase <i>bain sgilling eile as</i>. (Russell.)</p>

  <p>'I came against you' (more usually <i>agin you</i>) means 'I opposed
  you and defeated your schemes.' This is merely a translation of an Irish
  phrase, in which the preposition <i>le</i> or <i>re</i> is used in the
  sense of <i>against</i> or <i>in opposition to</i>: <i>do tháinic me leat
  annsin</i>. (S. H. O'Grady.) 'His sore knee came <i>against him</i>
  during the walk.'</p>

  <p><i>Against</i> is used by us in another sense&mdash;that of meeting:
  'he went against his father,' i.e. he went to meet his father [who was
  coming home from town]. This, which is quite common, is, I think, pure
  <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page32"></a>{32}</span>Anglo-Irish. But 'he laid up a supply of
  turf against the winter' is correct English as well as Anglo-Irish.</p>

  <p>A very common inquiry when you meet a friend is:&mdash;'How are all

  <p>A number of idiomatic expressions cluster round the word <i>head</i>,
  all of which are transplanted from Irish in the use of the Irish word
  <i>ceann</i> [cann] 'head'. <i>Head</i> is used to denote the cause,
  occasion, or motive of anything. 'Did he really walk that distance in a
  day?' Reply in Irish, <i>Ní'l contabhairt air bith ann a cheann</i>:
  'there is no doubt at all <i>on the head of it</i>,' i.e. about it, in
  regard to it. 'He is a bad head to me,' i.e. he treats me badly. Merely
  the Irish <i>is olc an ceann dom é</i>. <i>Bhi fearg air da chionn</i>,
  he was vexed on the head of it.</p>

  <p>A dismissed clerk says:&mdash;'I made a mistake in one of the books,

  <p>This is a translation of a very common Irish expression as seen
  in:&mdash;<i>Budh mhó an sgéile Diarmaid</i> <!-- Page 33 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>{33}</span><i>do bheith marbh</i>:
  'More's the pity Dermot to be dead.' (Story of 'Dermot and Grania.')</p>

  <p>'Who should come up to me in the fair but John.' Intended not for a
  question but for an assertion&mdash;an assertion of something which was
  hardly expected. This mode of expression, which is very common, is a
  Gaelic construction. Thus in the song <i>Fáinne geal an lae:&mdash;Cia
  gheabhainn le m'ais acht cúilfhionn deas</i>: 'Whom should I find near by
  me but the pretty fair haired girl.' 'Who should walk in only his dead
  wife.' (Gerald Griffin: 'Collegians.') 'As we were walking along what
  should happen but John to stumble and fall on the road.'</p>

  <p>The pronouns <i>myself</i>, <i>himself</i>, &amp;c., are very often
  used in Ireland in a peculiar way, which will be understood from the
  following examples:&mdash;'The birds were singing <i>for themselves</i>.'
  'I was looking about the fair <i>for myself</i>' (Gerald Griffin:
  'Collegians'): 'he is pleasant <i>in himself</i> (ibid.): 'I felt dead
  [dull] <i>in myself</i>' (ibid.). 'Just at that moment I happened to be
  walking by myself' (i.e. alone: Irish, <i>liom féin</i>). Expressions of
  this kind are all borrowed direct from Irish.</p>

  <p>We have in our Irish-English a curious use of the personal pronouns
  which will be understood from the following examples:&mdash;'He
  interrupted me <i>and I writing</i> my letters' (as I was writing). 'I
  found Phil there too <i>and he playing</i> his fiddle for the company.'
  This, although very incorrect English, is a classic idiom in Irish, from
  which it has been imported as it stands into our English.
  Thus:&mdash;<i>Do chonnairc me Tomás agus é n'a shuidhe cois na
  teine</i>: 'I saw Thomas <i>and he sitting</i> beside the fire.' 'How
  could you see <!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page34"></a>{34}</span>me there <i>and I to be in bed at the
  time</i>?' This latter part is merely a translation from the correct
  Irish:&mdash;<i>agus meise do bheith mo luidhe ag an am sin</i> (Irish
  Tale). Any number of examples of this usage might be culled from both
  English and Irish writings. Even so classical a writer as Wolfe follows
  this usage in 'The Burial of Sir John Moore':&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'We thought ...</p>
      <p>That the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head,</p>
      <p><i>And we far away</i> on the billow.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>(I am reminded of this by Miss Hayden and Prof. Hartog.)</p>

  <p>But there is a variety in our English use of the pronouns here,
  namely, that we often use the objective (or accusative) case instead of
  the nominative. 'How could you expect Davy to do the work <i>and him so
  very sick</i>?' 'My poor man fell into the fire a Sunday night <i>and him
  hearty</i>' (<i>hearty</i>, half drunk: Maxwell, 'Wild Sports of the
  West'). 'Is that what you lay out for me, mother, <i>and me after turning
  the Voster</i>' (i.e. after working through the whole of Voster's
  Arithmetic: Carleton). 'John and Bill were both reading and <i>them
  eating their dinner</i>' (while they were eating their dinner). This is
  also from the Irish language. We will first take the third person plural
  pronoun. The pronoun 'they' is in Irish <i>siad</i>: and the accusative
  'them' is the Irish <i>iad</i>. But in some Irish constructions this
  <i>iad</i> is (correctly) used as a nominative; and in imitation of this
  our people often use 'them' as a nominative:&mdash;'<i>Them</i> are just
  the gloves I want.' '<i>Them</i> are the boys' is exactly translated from
  the correct Irish <i>is</i> <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page35"></a>{35}</span><i>iad sin na buachaillidhe</i>. 'Oh she
  melted the hearts of the swains in <i>them</i> parts.' ('The Widow
  Malone,' by Lever.)</p>

  <p>In like manner with the pronouns <i>sé</i>, <i>sí</i> (he, she), of
  which the accusatives <i>é</i> and <i>í</i> are in certain Irish
  constructions (correctly) used for the nominative forms, which accusative
  forms are (incorrectly) imported into English. <i>Do chonnairc mé Seadhán
  agus é n'a shuidhe</i>, 'I saw Shaun and <i>him</i> sitting down,' i.e.
  'as he was sitting down.' So also 'don't ask me to go and <i>me</i>
  having a sore foot.' 'There's the hen and <i>her</i> as fat as butter,'
  i.e. 'she (the hen) being as fat as butter.'</p>

  <p>The little phrase 'the way' is used among us in several senses, all
  peculiar, and all derived from Irish. Sometimes it is a direct
  translation from <i>amhlaidh</i> ('thus,' 'so,' 'how,' 'in a manner'). An
  old example of this use of <i>amhlaidh</i> in Irish is the following
  passage from the <i>Boroma</i> (<i>Silva Gadelica</i>):&mdash;<i>Is
  amlaid at chonnaic [Concobar] Laigin ocus Ulaid mán dabaig ocá hól</i>:
  'It is how (or 'the way') [Concobar] saw the Lagenians and the Ulstermen
  [viz. they were] round the vat drinking from it.' <i>Is amhlaidh do bhi
  Fergus</i>: 'It is thus (or the way) Fergus was [conditioned; that his
  shout was heard over three cantreds].'</p>

  <p>This same sense is also seen in the expression, 'this is the way I
  made my money,' i.e. 'this is how I made it.'</p>

  <p>When this expression, 'the way,' or 'how,' introduces a statement it
  means ''tis how it happened.' 'What do you want, James?' ''Tis the way
  ma'am, my mother sent me for the loan of the <!-- Page 36 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>{36}</span>shovel.' This idiom is
  very common in Limerick, and is used indeed all through Ireland.</p>

  <p>Very often 'the way' is used in the sense of 'in order
  that':&mdash;'Smoking carriages are lined with American cloth <i>the
  way</i> they wouldn't keep the smell'; 'I brought an umbrella <i>the
  way</i> I wouldn't get wet'; 'you want not to let the poor boy do for
  himself [by marrying] <i>the way</i> that you yourself should have all.'
  (Ir. Pen. Mag.) You constantly hear this in Dublin, even among educated
  people.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the word <i>way</i> is a direct translation from the Irish
  <i>caoi</i>, 'a way,' 'a road'; so that the common Irish salutation,
  <i>Cad chaoi bh-fuil tu</i>? is translated with perfect correctness into
  the equally common Irish-English salute, 'What way are you?' meaning 'How
  are you?'</p>

  <p>'This way' is often used by the people in the sense of 'by this
  time':&mdash;'The horse is ready this way,' i.e. 'ready by this time.'
  (Gerald Griffin, 'Collegians.')</p>

  <p>The word <i>itself</i> is used in a curious way in Ireland, which has
  been something of a puzzle to outsiders. As so used it has no gender,
  number, or case; it is not in fact a pronoun at all, but a substitute for
  the word <i>even</i>. This has arisen from the fact that in the common
  colloquial Irish language the usual word to express both <i>even</i> and
  <i>itself</i>, is <i>féin</i>; and in translating a sentence containing
  this word <i>féin</i>, the people rather avoided <i>even</i>, a word not
  very familiar to them in this sense, and substituted the better known
  <i>itself</i>, in cases where <i>even</i> would be the correct word, and
  <i>itself</i> would be incorrect. Thus <i>da mbeith an meud sin féin
  agum</i> is correctly rendered 'if I had <!-- Page 37 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>{37}</span>even that much': but the
  people don't like <i>even</i>, and don't well understand it (as applied
  here), so they make it 'If I had that much <i>itself</i>.' This explains
  all such Anglo-Irish sayings as 'if I got it itself it would be of no use
  to me,' i.e. 'even if I got it': 'If she were there itself I wouldn't
  know her'; 'She wouldn't go to bed till you'd come home, and if she did
  itself she couldn't sleep.' (Knocknagow.) A woman is finding some fault
  with the arrangements for a race, and Lowry Looby (Collegians) puts in
  'so itself what hurt' i.e. 'even so what harm.' (Russell and myself.)</p>

  <p>The English <i>when</i> is expressed by the Irish <i>an uair</i>,
  which is literally 'the hour' or 'the time.' This is often transplanted
  into English; as when a person says 'the time you arrived I was away in
  town.'</p>

  <p>When you give anything to a poor person the recipient commonly utters
  the wish 'God increase you!' (meaning your substance): which is an exact
  translation of the equally common Irish wish <i>Go meádaighe Dia
  dhuit</i>. Sometimes the prayer is 'God increase your store,' which
  expresses exactly what is meant in the Irish wish.</p>

  <p>The very common aspiration 'God help us' [you, me, them, &amp;c.] is a
  translation of the equally common <i>Go bh-fóireadh Dia orruinn</i>
  [<i>ort</i>, &amp;c.].</p>

  <p>In the north-west instead of 'your father,' 'your sister,' &amp;c.,
  they often say 'the father of you,' 'the sister of you,' &amp;c.; and
  correspondingly as to things:&mdash;'I took the hand of her' (i.e. her
  hand) (Seumas Mac Manus).</p>

  <p>All through Ireland you will hear <i>show</i> used instead of
  <i>give</i> or <i>hand</i> (verb), in such phrases as <!-- Page 38
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>{38}</span>'Show me that
  knife,' i.e. hand it to me. 'Show me the cream, please,' says an Irish
  gentleman at a London restaurant; and he could not see why his English
  friends were laughing.</p>

  <p>'He passed me in the street <i>by the way</i> he didn't know me'; 'he
  refused to give a contribution <i>by the way</i> he was so poor.' In
  both, <i>by the way</i> means 'pretending.'</p>

  <p>'My own own people' means my immediate relations. This is a
  translation of <i>mo mhuinterse féin</i>. In Irish the repetition of the
  emphatic pronominal particles is very common, and is imported into
  English; represented here by 'own own.'</p>

  <p>A prayer or a wish in Irish often begins with the particle <i>go</i>,
  meaning 'that' (as a conjunction): <i>Go raibh maith agut</i>,
  '<i>that</i> it may be well with you,' i.e. 'May it be well with you.' In
  imitation or translation of this the corresponding expression in English
  is often opened by this word <i>that</i>: 'that you may soon get well,'
  i.e., 'may you soon get well.' Instead of 'may I be there to see' (John
  Gilpin) our people would say 'that I may be there to see.' A person
  utters some evil wish such as 'may bad luck attend you,' and is answered
  'that the prayer may happen the preacher.' A usual ending of a story told
  orally, when the hero and heroine have been comfortably disposed of is
  'And if they don't live happy <i>that we may</i>.'</p>

  <p>When a person sees anything unusual or unexpected, he says to his
  companion, 'Oh do you mind that!'</p>

  <p>'You want me to give you £10 for that cow: well, I'm not so soft
  <i>all out</i>.' 'He's not so bad as that <i>all out</i>.' <!-- Page 39
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>{39}</span></p>

  <p>A common expression is 'I was talking to him to-day, and I <i>drew
  down about</i> the money,' i.e. I brought on or introduced the subject.
  This is a translation of the Irish form <i>do tharraing me anuas</i> 'I
  drew down.'</p>

  <p>Quite a common form of expression is 'I had like to be killed,' i.e.,
  I was near being killed: I had a narrow escape of being killed: I escaped
  being killed <i>by the black of my nail</i>.</p>

  <p>Where the English say <i>it rains</i>, we say 'it is raining': which
  is merely a translation of the Irish way of saying it:&mdash;<i>ta se ag
  fearthainn</i>.</p>

  <p>The usual Gaelic equivalent of 'he gave a roar' is <i>do léig sé géim
  as</i> (met everywhere in Irish texts), 'he let a roar out of him'; which
  is an expression you will often hear among people who have not well
  mastered English&mdash;who in fact often speak the Irish language with
  English words.</p>

  <p>'I put it before me to do it,' meaning I was resolved to do it, is the
  literal translation of <i>chuireas rómhaim é to dheunamh</i>. Both Irish
  and Anglo-Irish are very common in the respective languages.</p>

  <p>When a narrator has come to the end of some minor episode in his
  narrative, he often resumes with the opening 'That was well and good':
  which is merely a translation of the Gaelic <i>bhí sin go maith</i>.</p>

  <p>Lowry Looby having related how the mother and daughter raised a
  terrible <i>pillilu</i>, i.e., 'roaring and bawling,' says after a short
  pause 'that was well and good,' and proceeds with his story. (Gerald
  Griffin: 'Collegians.')</p>

  <p>A common Irish expression interjected into a narrative or discourse,
  as a sort of stepping stone <!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page40"></a>{40}</span>between what is ended and what is coming is
  <i>Ní'l tracht air</i>, 'there is no talking about it,' corresponding to
  the English 'in short,' or 'to make a long story short.' These Irish
  expressions are imported into our English, in which popular phrases like
  the following are very often heard:&mdash;'I went to the fair, and
  <i>there's no use in talking</i>, I found the prices real bad.'</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Wisha my bones are exhausted, and <i>there's no use in talking</i>,</p>
      <p>My heart is scalded, <i>a wirrasthru</i>.'</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>(Old Song.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>'Where is my use in staying here, so there's no use in talking, go I
  will.' ('Knocknagow.') Often the expression takes this form:&mdash;'Ah
  'tis a folly to talk, he'll never get that money.'</p>

  <p>Sometimes the original Irish is in question form. <i>Cid tracht</i>
  ('what talking?' i.e. 'what need of talking?') which is Englished as
  follows:&mdash;'Ah what's the use of talking, your father will never
  consent.' These expressions are used in conversational Irish-English, not
  for the purpose of continuing a narrative as in the original Irish,
  but&mdash;as appears from the above examples&mdash;merely to add emphasis
  to an assertion.</p>

  <p>'It's a fine day that.' This expression, which is common enough among
  us, is merely a translation from the common Irish phrase <i>is breagh an
  lá é sin</i>, where the demonstrative <i>sin</i> (that) comes last in the
  proper Irish construction: but when imitated in English it looks queer to
  an English listener or reader.</p>

  <p>'<i>There is no doubt</i> that is a splendid animal.' This expression
  is a direct translation from the Irish <i>Ní'l contabhairt ann</i>, and
  is equivalent to the English 'doubtless.' It occurs often in the Scottish
  dialect also:&mdash;'Ye need na doubt I held my whisht' (Burns). <!--
  Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>{41}</span></p>

  <p>You are about to drink from a cup. 'How much shall I put into this cup
  for you?' 'Oh you may give me <i>the full of it</i>.' This is
  Irish-English: in England they would say&mdash;'Give it to me full.' Our
  expression is a translation from the Irish language. For example,
  speaking of a drinking-horn, an old writer says, <i>a lán do'n lionn</i>,
  literally, 'the full of it of ale.' In Silva Gadelica we find <i>lán a
  ghlaice deise do losaibh</i>, which an Irishman translating literally
  would render 'the full of his right hand of herbs,' while an Englishman
  would express the same idea in this way&mdash;'his right hand full of
  herbs.'</p>

  <p>Our Irish-English expression 'to come round a person' means to induce
  or <i>circumvent</i> him by coaxing cuteness and wheedling: 'He came
  round me by his <i>sleudering</i> to lend him half a crown, fool that I
  was': 'My grandchildren came round me to give them money for sweets.'
  This expression is borrowed from Irish:&mdash;'When the Milesians reached
  Erin <i>tanic a ngáes timchioll Tuathi De Danand</i>, 'their cuteness
  circumvented (lit. 'came round') the Dedannans.' (Opening sentence in
  <i>Mesca Ulad</i> in Book of Leinster: Hennessy.)</p>

  <p>'Shall I do so and so?' 'What would prevent you?' A very usual
  Hibernian-English reply, meaning 'you may do it of course; there is
  nothing to prevent you.' This is borrowed or translated from an Irish
  phrase. In the very old tale <i>The Voyage of Maildune</i>, Maildune's
  people ask, 'Shall we speak to her [the lady]?' and he replies <i>Cid
  gatas uait ce atberaid fria</i>. 'What [is it] that takes [anything] from
  you though ye speak to her,' as much as to say, 'what harm will it do you
  if you speak to her?' <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page42"></a>{42}</span>equivalent to 'of course you may, there's
  nothing to prevent you.'</p>

  <p>That old horse is <i>lame of one leg</i>, one of our very usual forms
  of expression, which is merely a translation from <i>bacach ar
  aonchois</i>. (MacCurtin.) 'I'll seem to be lame, quite useless of one of
  my hands.' (Old Song.)</p>

  <p>Such constructions as <i>amadán fir</i> 'a fool of a man' are very
  common in Irish, with the second noun in the genitive (<i>fear</i> 'a
  man,' gen. <i>fir</i>) meaning 'a man who is a fool.' <i>Is and is ail
  ollamhan</i>, 'it is then he is a rock of an <i>ollamh</i> (doctor), i.e.
  a doctor who is a rock [of learning]. (Book of Rights.) So also 'a thief
  of a fellow,' 'a steeple of a man,' i.e. a man who is a steeple&mdash;so
  tall. This form of expression is however common in England both among
  writers and speakers. It is noticed here because it is far more general
  among us, for the obvious reason that it has come to us from two sources
  (instead of one)&mdash;Irish and English.</p>

  <p>'I removed to Dublin this day twelve months, and this day two years I
  will go back again to Tralee.' 'I bought that horse last May was a
  twelvemonth, and he will be three years old come Thursday next.' 'I'll
  not sell my pigs till coming on summer': a translation of <i>air theacht
  an t-samhraidh</i>. Such Anglo-Irish expressions are very general, and
  are all from the Irish language, of which many examples might be given,
  but this one from 'The Courtship of Emer,' twelve or thirteen centuries
  old, will be enough. [It was prophesied] that the boy would come to Erin
  that day seven years&mdash;<i>dia secht m-bliadan</i>. (Kuno Meyer.) <!--
  Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>{43}</span></p>

  <p>In our Anglo-Irish dialect the expression <i>at all</i> is often
  duplicated for emphasis: 'I'll grow no corn this year at all at all': 'I
  have no money at all at all.' So prevalent is this among us that in a
  very good English grammar recently published (written by an Irishman)
  speakers and writers are warned against it. This is an importation from
  Irish. One of the Irish words for 'at all' is <i>idir</i> (always used
  after a negative), old forms <i>itir</i> and <i>etir</i>:&mdash;<i>nir bo
  tol do Dubthach recc na cumaile etir</i>, 'Dubthach did not wish to sell
  the bondmaid at all.' In the following old passage, and others like it,
  it is duplicated for emphasis <i>Cid beac, itir itir, ges do obar</i>:
  'however little it is forbidden to work, at all at all.' ('Prohibitions
  of beard,' O'Looney.)</p>

  <p>When it is a matter of indifference which of two things to choose, we
  usually say 'It is equal to me' (or 'all one to me'), which is just a
  translation of <i>is cuma liom</i> (best rendered by 'I don't care').
  Both Irish and English expressions are very common in the respective
  languages. Lowry Looby says:&mdash;'It is equal to me whether I walk ten
  or twenty miles.' (Gerald Griffin.)</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'I am a bold bachelor, airy and free,</p>
      <p>Both cities and counties are equal to me.'</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>(Old Song.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>'Do that out of the face,' i.e. begin at the beginning and finish it
  out and out: a translation of <i>deun sin as eudan</i>.</p>

  <p>'The day is rising' means the day is clearing up,&mdash;the rain, or
  snow, or wind is ceasing&mdash;the weather is becoming fine: a common
  saying in Ireland: a translation of the usual Irish expression <i>tá an
  lá</i> <!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page44"></a>{44}</span><i>ag éirghidh</i>. During the height of the
  great wind storm of 1842 a poor <i>shooler</i> or 'travelling man' from
  Galway, who knew little English, took refuge in a house in Westmeath,
  where the people were praying in terror that the storm might go down. He
  joined in, and unconsciously translating from his native Irish, he kept
  repeating 'Musha, that the Lord may rise it, that the Lord may rise it.'
  At which the others were at first indignant, thinking he was asking God
  to <i>raise</i> the wind higher still. (Russell.)</p>

  <p>Sometimes two prepositions are used where one would do:&mdash;'The dog
  got <i>in under</i> the bed:' 'Where is James? He's <i>in in</i> the
  room&mdash;or inside in the room.'</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Old woman, old woman, old woman,' says I,</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Where are you going up so high?'</p>
      <p class="hg1">'To sweep the cobwebs <i>off o'</i> the sky.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Whether this duplication <i>off of</i> is native Irish or old English
  it is not easy to say: but I find this expression in 'Robinson
  Crusoe':&mdash;'For the first time since the storm <i>off of</i>
  Hull.'</p>

  <p>Eva, the witch, says to the children of Lir, when she had turned them
  into swans:&mdash;<i>Amach daoibh a chlann an righ</i>: 'Out with you [on
  the water] ye children of the king.' This idiom which is quite common in
  Irish, is constantly heard among English speakers:&mdash;'Away with you
  now'&mdash;'Be off with yourself.'</p>

  <p>'Are you going away now?' One of the Irish forms of answering this is
  <i>Ní fós</i>, which in Kerry the people translate 'no yet,' considering
  this nearer to the original than the usual English 'not yet.' <!-- Page
  45 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>{45}</span></p>

  <p>The usual way in Irish of saying <i>he died</i> is <i>fuair sé
  bás</i>, i.e. 'he found (or got) death,' and this is sometimes imitated
  in Anglo-Irish:&mdash;'He was near getting his death from that wetting';
  'come out of that draught or you'll get your death.'</p>

  <p>The following curious form of expression is very often
  heard:&mdash;'Remember you have gloves to buy for me in town'; instead of
  'you have to buy me gloves.' 'What else have you to do to-day?' 'I have a
  top to bring to Johnny, and when I come home I have the cows to put in
  the stable'&mdash;instead of 'I have to bring a top'&mdash;'I have to put
  the cows.' This is an imitation of Irish, though not, I think, a direct
  translation.</p>

  <p>What may be called the Narrative Infinitive is a very usual
  construction in Irish. An Irish writer, relating a past event (and using
  the Irish language) instead of beginning his narrative in this way,
  'Donall O'Brien went on an expedition against the English of Athlone,'
  will begin 'Donall O'Brien <i>to go</i> on an expedition,' &amp;c. No
  Irish examples of this need be given here, as they will be found in every
  page of the Irish Annals, as well as in other Irish writings. Nothing
  like this exists in English, but the people constantly imitate it in the
  Anglo-Irish speech. 'How did you come by all that money?'
  Reply:&mdash;'To get into the heart of the fair' (meaning 'I got into the
  heart of the fair'), and to cry <i>old china</i>, &amp;c. (Gerald
  Griffin.) 'How was that, Lowry?' asks Mr. Daly: and Lowry
  answers:&mdash;'Some of them Garryowen boys sir to get about Danny Mann.'
  (Gerald Griffin: 'Collegians.') 'How did the mare get that hurt?' 'Oh Tom
  Cody to leap <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page46"></a>{46}</span>her over the garden wall yesterday, and she
  to fall on her knees on the stones.'</p>

  <p>The Irish language has the word <i>annso</i> for <i>here</i>, but it
  has no corresponding word <i>derived from annso</i>, to signify
  <i>hither</i>, though there are words for this too, but not from
  <i>annso</i>. A similar observation applies to the Irish for the words
  <i>there</i> and <i>thither</i>, and for <i>where</i> and <i>whither</i>.
  As a consequence of this our people do not use <i>hither</i>,
  <i>thither</i>, and <i>whither</i> at all. They make <i>here</i>,
  <i>there</i>, and <i>where</i> do duty for them. Indeed much the same
  usage exists in the Irish language too: <i>Is ann tigdaois eunlaith</i>
  (Keating): 'It is <i>here</i> the birds used to come,' instead of
  <i>hither</i>. In consequence of all this you will hear everywhere in
  Anglo-Irish speech:&mdash;'John came here yesterday': 'come here Patsy':
  'your brother is in Cork and you ought to go <i>there</i> to see him':
  '<i>where</i> did you go yesterday after you parted from me?'</p>

  <p>'Well Jack how are you these times?' 'Oh, indeed Tom I'm purty well
  thank you&mdash;<i>all that's left of me</i>': a mock way of speaking, as
  if the hard usage of the world had worn him to a thread. 'Is Frank
  Magaveen there?' asks the blind fiddler. 'All that's left of me is here,'
  answers Frank. (Carleton.) These expressions, which are very usual, and
  many others of the kind, are borrowed from the Irish. In the Irish tale,
  'The Battle of Gavra,' poor old Osheen, the sole survivor of the Fena,
  says:&mdash;'I know not where to follow them [his lost friends]; and this
  makes <i>the little remnant that is left of me</i> wretched. (<i>D'fúig
  sin m'iarsma</i>).</p>

  <p>Ned Brophy, introducing his wife to Mr. Lloyd, says, 'this is
  <i>herself</i> sir.' This is an extremely <!-- Page 47 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>{47}</span>common form of phrase.
  'Is <i>herself</i> [i.e. the mistress] at home Jenny?' 'I'm afraid
  himself [the master of the house] will be very angry when he hears about
  the accident to the mare.' This is an Irish idiom. The Irish chiefs, when
  signing their names to any document, always wrote the name in this form,
  <i>Misi O'Neill</i>, i.e. 'Myself O'Neill.'</p>

  <p>A usual expression is 'I have no Irish,' i.e. I do not know or speak
  Irish. This is exactly the way of saying it in Irish, of which the above
  is a translation:&mdash;<i>Ní'l Gaodhlainn agum</i>.</p>

  <p>To <i>let on</i> is to pretend, and in this sense is used everywhere
  in Ireland. 'Oh your father is very angry': 'Not at all, he's only
  letting on.' 'If you meet James don't let on you saw me,' is really a
  positive, not a negative request: equivalent to&mdash;'If you meet James,
  let on (pretend) that you didn't see me.' A Dublin working-man recently
  writing in a newspaper says, 'they passed me on the bridge (Cork), and
  never let on to see me' (i.e. 'they let on not to see me').</p>

  <p>'He is all <i>as one as</i> recovered now'; he is nearly the same as
  recovered.</p>

  <p>At the proper season you will often see auctioneers'
  posters:&mdash;'To be sold by auction 20 acres of splendid meadow <i>on
  foot</i>,' &amp;c. This term <i>on foot</i>, which is applied in Ireland
  to <i>growing</i> crops of all kinds&mdash;corn, flax, meadow,
  &amp;c.&mdash;is derived from the Irish language, in which it is used in
  the oldest documents as well as in the everyday spoken modern Irish; the
  usual word <i>cos</i> for 'foot' being used. Thus in the Brehon Laws we
  are told that a wife's share of the flax is one-ninth if it be on foot
  (<i>for a cois</i>, <!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page48"></a>{48}</span>'on its foot,' modern form <i>air a
  chois</i>) one-sixth after being dried, &amp;c. In one place a fine is
  mentioned for appropriating or cutting furze if it be 'on foot.' (Br.
  Laws.)</p>

  <p>This mode of speaking is applied in old documents to animals also.
  Thus in one of the old Tales is mentioned a present of a swine and an ox
  <i>on foot</i> (<i>for a coiss</i>, 'on their foot') to be given to Mac
  Con and his people, i.e. to be sent to them alive&mdash;not slaughtered.
  (Silva Gadelica.) But I have not come across this application in our
  modern Irish-English.</p>

  <p>To give a thing 'for God's sake,' i.e. to give it in charity or for
  mere kindness, is an expression very common at the present day all over
  Ireland. 'Did you sell your turf-rick to Bill Fennessy?' Oh no, I gave it
  to him for God's sake: he's very badly off now poor fellow, and I'll
  never miss it.' Our office attendant Charlie went to the clerk, who was
  chary of the pens, and got a supply with some difficulty. He came back
  grumbling:&mdash;'A person would think I was asking them for God's sake'
  (a thoroughly Hibernian sentence). This expression is common also in
  Irish, both ancient and modern, from which the English is merely a
  translation. Thus in the Brehon Laws we find mention of certain young
  persons being taught a trade 'for God's sake' (<i>ar Dia</i>), i.e.
  without fee: and in another place a man is spoken of as giving a poor
  person something 'for God's sake.'</p>

  <p>The word <i>'nough</i>, shortened from <i>enough</i>, is always used
  in English with the possessive pronouns, in accordance with the Gaelic
  construction in such phrases as <i>gur itheadar a n-doithin díobh</i>,
  'So that <!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page49"></a>{49}</span>they ate their enough of them' ('Diarmaid
  and Grainne'): <i>d'ith mo shaith</i> 'I ate my enough.' Accordingly
  uneducated people use the word <i>'nough</i> in this manner, exactly as
  <i>fill</i> is correctly used in 'he ate his fill.' Lowry Looby wouldn't
  like to be 'a born gentleman' for many reasons&mdash;among others that
  you're expected 'not to ate half your 'nough at dinner.' (Gerald Griffin:
  'Collegians.')</p>

  <p>The words <i>world</i> and <i>earth</i> often come into our
  Anglo-Irish speech in a way that will be understood and recognised from
  the following examples:&mdash;'Where in the world are you going so
  early?' 'What in the world kept you out so long?' 'What on earth is wrong
  with you?' 'That cloud looks for all the world like a man.' 'Oh you young
  thief of the world, why did you do that?' (to a child). These expressions
  are all thrown in for emphasis, and they are mainly or altogether
  imported from the Irish. They are besides of long standing. In the
  'Colloquy'&mdash;a very old Irish piece&mdash;the king of Leinster says
  to St. Patrick:&mdash;'I do not know <i>in the world</i> how it fares
  [with my son].' So also in a still older story, 'The Voyage of
  Maildune':&mdash;'And they [Maildune and his people] knew not whither
  <i>in the world</i> (<i>isan bith</i>) they were going. In modern Irish,
  <i>Ní chuirionn sé tábhacht a n-éinidh san domhuin</i>: 'he minds nothing
  in the world.' (Mac Curtin.)</p>

  <p>But I think some of the above expressions are found in good English
  too, both old and new. For example in a letter to Queen Elizabeth the
  Earl of Ormond (an Irishman&mdash;one of the Butlers) designates a
  certain Irish chief 'that most arrogant, <!-- Page 50 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>{50}</span>vile, traitor of the
  world Owney M&lsquo;Rorye' [O'Moore]. But perhaps he wrote this with an
  Irish pen.</p>

  <p>A person does something to displease me&mdash;insults me, breaks down
  my hedge&mdash;and I say 'I will not let that go with him': meaning I
  will bring him to account for it, I will take satisfaction, I will punish
  him. This, which is very usual, is an Irish idiom. In the story of The
  Little Brawl of Allen, Goll boasts of having slain Finn's father; and
  Finn answers <i>bud maith m'acfainnse ar gan sin do léicen let</i>, 'I am
  quite powerful enough not to let that go with you.' ('Silva Gadelica.')
  Sometimes this Anglo-Irish phrase means to vie with, to rival. 'There's
  no doubt that old Tom Long is very rich': 'Yes indeed, but I think Jack
  Finnerty <i>wouldn't let it go with him</i>.' Lory Hanly at the dance,
  seeing his three companions sighing and obviously in love with three of
  the ladies, feels himself just as bad for a fourth, and sighing, says to
  himself that he 'wouldn't let it go with any of them.'
  ('Knocknagow.')</p>

  <p>'I give in to you' means 'I yield to you,' 'I assent to (or believe)
  what you say,' 'I acknowledge you are right': 'He doesn't give in that
  there are ghosts at all.' This is an Irish idiom, as will be seen in the
  following:&mdash;[A lion and three dogs are struggling for the mastery
  and] <i>adnaigit [an triur eile] do [an leomain]</i> 'And the three
  others gave in to the [lion].'</p>

  <p>This mode of expression is however found in English
  also:&mdash;[Beelzebub] 'proposes a third undertaking which the whole
  assembly gives in to.' (Addison in 'Spectator.') <!-- Page 51 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>{51}</span></p>

  <p><i>For</i> is constantly used before the infinitive: 'he bought cloth
  <i>for to</i> make a coat.'</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'And "Oh sailor dear," said she,</p>
      <p class="hg3">"How came you here by me?"</p>
      <p class="i2">And then she began <i>for to cry</i>.'</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>(Old Irish Folk Song: 'The Boyne Water.')</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This idiom is in Irish also: <i>Deunaidh duthracht le leas bhur n-anma
  a dheunadh</i>: 'make an effort <i>for to accomplish</i> the amendment of
  your souls.' ('Dunlevy.') Two Irish prepositions are used in this sense
  of <i>for</i>: <i>le</i> (as above) and <i>chum</i>. But this use of
  <i>for</i> is also very general in English peasant language, as may be
  seen everywhere in Dickens.</p>

  <p><i>Is ceangailte do bhidhinn</i>, literally 'It is bound I should be,'
  i.e. in English 'I should be bound.' This construction (from 'Diarmaid
  and Grainne'), in which the position of the predicate as it would stand
  according to the English order is thrown back, is general in the Irish
  language, and quite as general in our Anglo-Irish, in imitation or
  translation. I once heard a man say in Irish <i>is e do chailleamhuin do
  rinn me</i>: 'It is to lose it I did' (I lost it). The following are
  everyday examples from our dialect of English: ''Tis to rob me you want':
  'Is it at the young woman's house the wedding is to be?' ('Knocknagow'):
  'Is it reading you are?' ''Twas to dhrame it I did sir' ('Knocknagow'):
  'Maybe 'tis turned out I'd be' ('Knocknagow'): 'To lose it I did' (Gerald
  Griffin: 'Collegians'): 'Well John I am glad to <!-- Page 52 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span>see you, and it's right
  well you look': [Billy thinks the fairy is mocking him, and says:&mdash;]
  'Is it after making a fool of me you'd be?' (Crofton Croker): 'To make
  for Rosapenna (Donegal) we did:' i.e., 'We made for Rosapenna': 'I'll
  tell my father about your good fortune, and 'tis he that will be
  delighted.'</p>

  <p>In the fine old Irish story the 'Pursuit of Dermot and Grania,' Grania
  says to her husband Dermot:&mdash;[Invite guests to a feast to our
  daughter's house] <i>agus ní feas nach ann do gheubhaidh fear chéile</i>;
  'and there is no knowing but that there she may get a husband.' This is
  almost identical with what Nelly Donovan says in our own day&mdash;in
  half joke&mdash;when she is going to Ned Brophy's
  wedding:&mdash;'There'll be some likely lads there to-night, and who
  knows what luck I might have.' ('Knocknagow.') This expression 'there is
  no knowing but' or 'who knows but,' borrowed as we see from Gaelic, is
  very common in our Anglo-Irish dialect. 'I want the loan of £20 badly to
  help to stock my farm, but how am I to get it?' His friend
  answers:&mdash;'Just come to the bank, and who knows but that they will
  advance it to you on my security:' meaning 'it is not unlikely&mdash;I
  think it rather probable&mdash;that they will advance it'</p>

  <p>'He looks like a man <i>that there would be</i> no money in his
  pocket': 'there's <i>a man that his wife leaves him</i> whenever she
  pleases.' These phrases and the like are heard all through the middle of
  Ireland, and indeed outside the middle: they are translations from Irish.
  Thus the italics of the second phrase would be in Irish <i>fear dá
  d-tréigeann a bhean é</i> (or <i>a thréigeas a bhean é</i>). 'Poor brave
  honest Mat Donovan that everyone is proud of <i>him</i> and fond <!--
  Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>{53}</span>of
  <i>him</i>' ('Knocknagow'): 'He was a descendant of Sir Thomas More that
  Henry VIII. cut his head off' (whose head Henry VIII. cut off). The
  phrases above are incorrect English, as there is redundancy; but they,
  and others like them, could generally be made correct by the use of
  <i>whose</i> or <i>of whom</i>:&mdash;'He looks like a man in whose
  pocket,' &amp;c.&mdash;'A man whose wife leaves him.' But the people in
  general do not make use of <i>whose</i>&mdash;in fact they do not know
  how to use it, except at the beginning of a question:&mdash;'Whose knife
  is this?' (Russell.) This is an excellent example of how a phrase may be
  good Irish but bad English.</p>

  <p>A man possesses some prominent quality, such as generosity, for which
  his father was also distinguished, and we say 'kind father for him,' i.e.
  'He is of the same <i>kind</i> as his father&mdash;he took it from his
  father.' So also ''Tis kind for the cat to drink milk'&mdash;'cat after
  kind'&mdash;''Tis kind for John to be good and honourable' [for his
  father or his people were so before him]. All this is from Irish, in
  which various words are used to express the idea of <i>kind</i> in this
  sense:&mdash;<i>bu cheneulta do</i>&mdash;<i>bu dhual do</i>&mdash;<i>bu
  dhuthcha do</i>.</p>

  <p>Very anxious to do a thing: ''Twas all his trouble to do so and so'
  ('Collegians'): corresponding to the Irish:&mdash;'<i>Is é mo chúram
  uile</i>,' 'He (or it) is all my care.' (MacCurtin.)</p>

  <p>Instead of 'The box will hold all the parcels' or 'All the parcels
  will fit into the box,' we in Ireland commonly say 'All the parcels
  <i>will go</i> into the box.' This is from a very old Gaelic usage, as
  may be seen from this quotation from the 'Boroma':&mdash;<i>Coire mór uma
  í teigtís dá muic déc</i>: 'A large bronze caldron <!-- Page 54 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>{54}</span>into which <i>would
  go</i> (téigtís) twelve [jointed] pigs.' ('Silva Gadelica.')</p>

  <p><i>Chevilles.</i> What is called in French a <i>cheville</i>&mdash;I
  do not know any Irish or English name for it&mdash;is a phrase
  interjected into a line of poetry merely to complete either the measure
  or the rhyme, with little or no use besides. The practice of using
  chevilles was very common in old Irish poetry, and a bad practice it was;
  for many a good poem is quite spoiled by the constant and wearisome
  recurrence of these <i>chevilles</i>. For instance here is a translation
  of a couple of verses from 'The Voyage of Maildune' with their
  <i>chevilles</i>:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'They met with an island after sailing&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i16"><i>wonderful the guidance</i>.</p>
      <p class="hg1">'The third day after, on the end of the rod&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i16"><i>deed of power</i>&mdash;</p>
      <p>The chieftain found&mdash;<i>it was a very great joy</i>&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i16">a cluster of apples.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In modern <i>Irish</i> popular poetry we have <i>chevilles</i> also;
  of which I think the commonest is the little phrase <i>gan go</i>,
  'without a lie'; and this is often reflected in our Anglo-Irish songs. In
  'Handsome Sally,' published in my 'Old Irish Music and Songs,' these
  lines occur:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Young men and maidens I pray draw near&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i8"><i>The truth to you I will now declare</i>&mdash;</p>
      <p>How a fair young lady's heart was won</p>
      <p class="i8">All by the loving of a farmer's son.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And in another of our songs:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Good people all I pray draw near&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i6"><i>No lie I'll tell to ye</i>&mdash;</p>
      <p>About a lovely fair maid,</p>
      <p class="i6">And her name is Polly Lee.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"></a>{55}</span></p>

  <p>This practice is met with also in English poetry, both classical and
  popular; but of course this is quite independent of the Irish custom.</p>

  <p><i>Assonance.</i> In the modern Irish language the verse rhymes are
  <i>assonantal</i>. Assonance is the correspondence of the vowels: the
  consonants count for nothing. Thus <i>fair</i>, <i>may</i>, <i>saint</i>,
  <i>blaze</i>, <i>there</i>, all rhyme assonantally. As it is easy to find
  words that rhyme in this manner, the rhymes generally occur much oftener
  in Anglo-Irish verse than in pure English, in which the rhymes are what
  English grammarians call <i>perfect</i>.</p>

  <p>Our rustic poets rhyme their English (or Irish-English) verse
  assonantally in imitation of their native language. For a very good
  example of this, see the song of Castlehyde in my 'Old Irish Music and
  Songs'; and it may be seen in very large numbers of our Anglo-Irish
  Folk-songs. I will give just one example here, a free translation of an
  elegy, rhyming like its original. To the ear of a person accustomed to
  assonance&mdash;as for instance to mine&mdash;the rhymes here are as
  satisfying as if they were <i>perfect</i> English rhymes.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE DEVIL AND HIS 'TERRITORY.'</p>

  <p>Bad as the devil is he has done us some service in Ireland by
  providing us with a fund of anecdotes and sayings full of drollery and
  fun. This is all against his own interests; for I remember reading in the
  works of some good old saint&mdash;I think it is St. Liguori&mdash;that
  the devil is always hovering near us watching his opportunity, and that
  one of the best means of scaring him off is a good honest hearty
  laugh.</p>

  <p>Those who wish to avoid uttering the plain straight name 'devil' often
  call him 'the Old Boy,' or 'Old Nick.'</p>

  <p>In some of the stories relating to the devil he is represented as a
  great simpleton and easily imposed upon: in others as clever at
  everything. In many he gets full credit for his badness, and all his
  attributes and all his actions are just the reverse of the good agencies
  of the world; so that his attempts at evil often tend for good, while
  anything he does for good&mdash;or pretending to be for good&mdash;turns
  to evil.</p>

  <p>When a person suffers punishment or injury of any kind that is well
  deserved&mdash;gets his deserts for misconduct or culpable mismanagement
  or excessive foolishness of any kind&mdash;we say 'the devil's cure to
  him,' or 'the devil mend him' (as much as to say <!-- Page 57 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>{57}</span>in English 'serve him
  right'); for if the devil goes to cure or to mend he only makes matters
  ten times worse. Dick Millikin of Cork (the poet of 'The Groves of
  Blarney') was notoriously a late riser. One morning as he was going very
  late to business, one of his neighbours, a Quaker, met him. 'Ah friend
  Dick thou art very late to-day: remember the early bird picks the worm.'
  'The devil mend the worm for being out so early,' replied Dick. So also
  'the devil bless you' is a bad wish, because the devil's blessing is
  equivalent to the curse of God; while 'the devil's curse to you' is
  considered a good wish, for the devil's curse is equal to God's blessing.
  (Carleton.) The devil comes in handy in many ways. What could be more
  expressive than this couplet of an old song describing a ruffian in a
  rage:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'He stamped and he cursed and he swore he would fight,</p>
      <p>And I saw the <i>ould</i> devil between his two eyes.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Sometimes the devil is taken as the type of excellence or of great
  proficiency in anything, or of great excess, so that you often hear 'That
  fellow is as old as the devil,' 'That beefsteak is as tough as the
  devil,' 'He beats the devil for roguery,' 'My landlord is civil, but dear
  as the divil.' (Swift: who wrote this with a pen dipped in Irish
  ink.)</p>

  <p>A poor wretch or a fellow always in debt and difficulty, and
  consequently shabby, is a 'poor devil'; and not very long ago I heard a
  friend say to another&mdash;who was not sparing of his
  labour&mdash;'Well, there's no doubt but you're a hard-working old
  devil.' <!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page58"></a>{58}</span></p>

  <p>Very bad potatoes:&mdash;'Wet and watery, scabby and small, thin in
  the ground and hard to dig, hard to wash, hard to boil, and <i>the devil
  to eat them</i>.'</p>

  <p>'I don't wonder that poor Bill should be always struggling, for he has
  the devil of an extravagant family.'</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Oh confusion to you Dan,' says the T. B. C.,</p>
      <p class="hg1">'You're the devil of a man,' says the T. B. C.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>(Repeal Song of 1843.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>(But this form of expression occurs in Dickens&mdash;'Our Mutual
  Friend'&mdash;'I have a devil of a temper myself'). An emphatic
  statement:&mdash;'I wouldn't like to trust him, for he's the <i>devil's
  own</i> rogue.'</p>

  <p>'There's no use in your trying that race against Johnny Keegan, for
  Johnny is the very devil at running.' 'Oh your reverence,' says Paddy
  Galvin, 'don't ax me to fast; but you may put as much prayers on me as
  you like: for, your reverence, I'm very bad at fasting, but I'm the divel
  at the prayers.' According to Mr. A. P. Graves, in 'Father O'Flynn,' the
  'Provost and Fellows of Trinity' [College, Dublin] are 'the divels an'
  all at Divinity.' This last expression is truly Hibernian, and is very
  often heard:&mdash;A fellow is boasting how he'll leather Jack Fox when
  next he meets him. 'Oh yes, you'll do the <i>devil an' all</i> while Jack
  is away; but wait till he comes to the fore.'</p>

  <p>In several of the following short stories and sayings the simpleton
  side of Satan's character is well brought out.</p>

  <p>Damer of Shronell, who lived in the eighteenth century, was reputed to
  be the richest man in Ireland&mdash;a sort of Irish Croesus: so that 'as
  rich as <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page59"></a>{59}</span>Damer' has become a proverb in the south of
  Ireland. An Irish peasant song-writer, philosophising on the vanity of
  riches, says:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'There was ould Paddy Murphy had money galore,</p>
      <p>And Damer of Shronell had twenty times more&mdash;</p>
      <p>They are now on their backs under nettles and stones.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Damer's house in ruins is still to be seen at Shronell, four miles
  west of Tipperary town. The story goes that he got his money by selling
  his soul to the devil for as much gold as would fill his boot&mdash;a top
  boot, i.e. one that reaches above the knee. On the appointed day the
  devil came with his pockets well filled with guineas and sovereigns, as
  much as he thought was sufficient to fill any boot. But meantime Damer
  had removed the heel and fixed the boot in the floor, with a hole in the
  boards underneath, opening into the room below. The devil flung in
  handful after handful till his pockets were empty, but still the boot was
  not filled. He then sent out a signal, such as they understand in
  hell&mdash;for they had wireless telegraphy there long before Mr.
  Marconi's Irish mother was born&mdash;on which a crowd of little imps
  arrived all laden with gold coins, which were emptied into the boot, and
  still no sign of its being filled. He had to send them many times for
  more, till at last he succeeded in filling <i>the room beneath</i> as
  well as the boot; on which the transaction was concluded. The legend does
  not tell what became of Damer in the end; but such agreements usually
  wind up (in Ireland) by the sinner tricking Satan out of his bargain.</p>

  <p>When a person does an evil deed under cover of some untruthful but
  plausible justification, or utters <!-- Page 60 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>{60}</span>a wicked saying under a
  disguise: that's 'blindfolding the devil in the dark.' The devil is as
  cute in the dark as in the light: and blindfolding him is useless and
  foolish: he is only laughing at you.</p>

  <p>'You're a very coarse Christian,' as the devil said to the hedgehog.
  (Tyrone.)</p>

  <p>The name and fame of the great sixteenth-century magician, Dr. Faust
  or Faustus, found way somehow to our peasantry; for it was quite common
  to hear a crooked knavish man spoken of in this way:&mdash;'That fellow
  is a match for the devil and <i>Dr. Fosther</i>.' (Munster.)</p>

  <p>The magpie has seven drops of the devil's blood in its body: the
  water-wagtail has three drops. (Munster.)</p>

  <p>When a person is unusually cunning, cute, and tricky, we say 'The
  devil is a poor scholar to you.' ('Poor scholar' here means a bad shallow
  scholar.)</p>

  <p>'Now since James is after getting all the money, <i>the devil can't
  howld him</i>': i.e. he has grown proud and overbearing.</p>

  <p>'<i>Firm and ugly</i>, as the devil said when he sewed his breeches
  with gads.' Here is how it happened. The devil was one day pursuing the
  soul of a sinner across country, and in leaping over a rough thorn hedge,
  he tore his breeches badly, so that his tail stuck out; on which he gave
  up the chase. As it was not decent to appear in public in that condition,
  he sat down and stitched up the rent with next to hand
  materials&mdash;viz. slender tough osier withes or <i>gads</i> as we call
  them in Ireland. When the job was finished he spread out the garment
  before him on his <!-- Page 61 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page61"></a>{61}</span>knees, and looking admiringly on his
  handiwork, uttered the above saying&mdash;'Firm and ugly!'</p>

  <p>The idea of the 'old boy' pursuing a soul appears also in the words of
  an old Anglo-Irish song about persons who commit great crimes and die
  unrepentant:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'For committing those crimes unrepented</p>
      <p class="i2">The devil shall after them run,</p>
      <p>And slash him for that at a furnace</p>
      <p class="i2">Where coal sells for nothing a ton.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A very wet day&mdash;teeming rain&mdash;raining cats and
  dogs&mdash;<i>a fine day for young ducks</i>:&mdash;'The devil wouldn't
  send out his dog on such a day as this.'</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Did you ever see the devil</p>
      <p>With the wooden spade and shovel</p>
      <p>Digging praties for his supper</p>
      <p class="i8">And his tail cocked up?'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A person struggling with poverty&mdash;constantly in money
  difficulties&mdash;is said to be 'pulling the devil by the tail.'</p>

  <p>'Great noise and little wool,' as the devil said when he was shearing
  a pig.</p>

  <p>'What's got over the devil's back goes off under the devil's belly.'
  This is another form of <i>ill got ill gone</i>.</p>

  <p>Don't enter on a lawsuit with a person who has in his hands the power
  of deciding the case. This would be 'going to law against the devil with
  the courthouse in hell.'</p>

  <p>Jack hates that man and all belonging to him 'as the devil hates holy
  water.'</p>

  <p><i>Yerra</i> or <i>arrah</i> is an exclamation very much in use in the
  South: a phonetic representation of the Irish <i>air&#x115;</i>, meaning
  <i>take care</i>, <i>look out</i>, <i>look you</i>:&mdash;'Yerra <!--
  Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>{62}</span>Bill why
  are you in such a hurry?' The old people didn't like our continual use of
  the word; and in order to deter us we were told that <i>Yerra</i> or
  <i>Arrah</i> was the name of the devil's mother! This would point to
  something like domestic conditions in the lower regions, and it is in a
  way corroborated by the words of an old song about a woman&mdash;a
  desperate old reprobate of a virago&mdash;who kicked up all sorts of
  ructions the moment she got inside the gate:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'When she saw the <i>young devils</i> tied up in their chains</p>
      <p>She up with her crutch and knocked one of their brains.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>'Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.' The people of Munster do
  not always put it that way; they have a version of their own:&mdash;'Time
  enough to bid the devil good-morrow when you meet him.' But an
  intelligent correspondent from Carlow puts a somewhat different
  interpretation on the last saying, namely, 'Don't go out of your way to
  seek trouble.'</p>

  <p>'When needs must the devil drives': a man in a great fix is often
  driven to illegal or criminal acts to extricate himself.</p>

  <p>When a man is threatened with a thrashing, another will say to
  him:&mdash;'You'll get Paddy Ryan's supper&mdash;<i>hard knocks and the
  devil to eat</i>': common in Munster.</p>

  <p>'When you sup with the devil have a long spoon': that is to say, if
  you have any dealings with rogues or criminals, adopt very careful
  precautions, and don't come into closer contact with them than is
  absolutely necessary. (Lover: but used generally.)</p>

  <p>'Speak the truth and shame the devil' is a very common saying. <!--
  Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63"></a>{63}</span></p>

  <p>'The devil's children have the devil's luck'; or 'the devil is good to
  his own': meaning bad men often prosper. But it is now generally said in
  joke to a person who has come in for an unexpected piece of good
  luck.</p>

  <p>A holy knave&mdash;something like our modern Pecksniff&mdash;dies and
  is sent in the downward direction: and&mdash;according to the words of
  the old folk-song&mdash;this is his reception:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'When hell's gate was opened the devil jumped with joy,</p>
      <p>Saying "I have a warm corner for you my holy boy."'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A man is deeply injured by another and threatens reprisal:&mdash;'I'll
  make you smell hell for that'; a bitter threat which may be paraphrased:
  I'll persecute you to death's door; and for you to be near death is to be
  near hell&mdash;I'll put you so near that you'll smell the fumes of the
  brimstone.</p>

  <p>A usual imprecation when a person who has made himself very unpopular
  is going away: 'the devil go with him.' One day a fellow was eating his
  dinner of dry potatoes, and had only one egg half raw for <i>kitchen</i>.
  He had no spoon, and took the egg in little sips intending to spread it
  over the dinner. But one time he tilted the shell too much, and down went
  the whole contents. After recovering from the gulp, he looked ruefully at
  the empty shell and blurted out&mdash;<i>the devil go with you
  down</i>!</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Many people think&mdash;and say it too&mdash;that it is an article of
  belief with Catholics that all Protestants when they die go straight to
  hell&mdash;which is a libel. Yet it is often kept up in joke, as in this
  and other <!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page64"></a>{64}</span>stories:&mdash;The train was skelping away
  like mad along the main line to hell&mdash;for they have railways
  <i>there</i> now&mdash;till at last it pulled up at the junction.
  Whereupon the porters ran round shouting out, 'Catholics change here for
  purgatory: Protestants keep your places!'</p>

  <p>This reminds us of Father O'Leary, a Cork priest of the end of the
  eighteenth century, celebrated as a controversialist and a wit. He was
  one day engaged in gentle controversy&mdash;or <i>argufying religion</i>
  as we call it in Ireland&mdash;with a Protestant friend, who plainly had
  the worst of the encounter. 'Well now Father O'Leary I want to ask what
  have you to say about purgatory?' 'Oh nothing,' replied the priest,
  'except that you might go farther and fare worse.'</p>

  <p>The same Father O'Leary once met in the streets a friend, a witty
  Protestant clergyman with whom he had many an encounter of wit and
  repartee. 'Ah Father O'Leary, have you heard the bad news?' 'No,' says
  Father O'Leary. 'Well, the bottom has fallen out of purgatory, and all
  the poor Papists have gone down into hell.' 'Oh the Lord save us,'
  answered Father O'Leary, 'what a crushing the poor Protestants must have
  got!'</p>

  <p>Father O'Leary and Curran&mdash;the great orator and wit&mdash;sat
  side by side once at a dinner party, where Curran was charmed with his
  reverend friend. 'Ah Father O'Leary,' he exclaimed at last, 'I wish you
  had the key of heaven.' 'Well Curran it might be better for you that I
  had the key of the other place.'</p>

  <p>A parish priest only recently dead, a well-known wit, sat beside a
  venerable Protestant clergyman at <!-- Page 65 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>{65}</span>dinner; and they got on
  very agreeably. This clergyman rather ostentatiously proclaimed his
  liberality by saying:&mdash;'Well Father &mdash;&mdash; I have been for
  <i>sixty years in this world</i> and I could never understand that there
  is any great and essential difference between the Catholic religion and
  the Protestant.' 'I can tell you,' replied Father &mdash;&mdash;, 'that
  when you die you'll not be <i>sixty minutes in the other world</i> before
  you will understand it perfectly.'</p>

  <p>The preceding are all in joke: but I once heard the idea enunciated in
  downright earnest. In my early life, we, the village people, were a mixed
  community, about half and half Catholics and Protestants, the latter
  nearly all Palatines, who were Methodists to a man. We got on very well
  together, and I have very kindly memories of my old playfellows,
  Palatines as well as Catholics.</p>

  <p>One young Palatine, Peter Stuffle, differed in one important respect
  from the others, as he never attended Church Mass or Meeting. He
  emigrated to America; and being a level headed fellow and keeping from
  drink, he got on. At last he came across Nelly Sullivan, a bright eyed
  colleen all the way from Kerry, a devoted Catholic, and fell head and
  ears in love with her. She liked him too, but would have nothing to say
  to him unless he became a Catholic: in the words of the old song, 'Unless
  that you turn a <i>Roman</i> you ne'er shall get me for your bride.'
  Peter's theology was not proof against Nelly's bright face: he became a
  Catholic, and a faithful one too: for once he was inside the gate his

  duties. <!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>They prospered; so that at the end of some years he was able to visit
  his native place. On his arrival nothing could exceed the consternation
  and rage of his former friends to find that instead of denouncing the
  Pope, he was now a flaming papist: and they all disowned and boycotted
  him. So he visited round his Catholic neighbours who were very glad to
  receive him. I was present at one of the conversations: when Peter,
  recounting his successful career, wound up with:&mdash;'So you see,
  James, that I am now well off, thanks be to God and to Nelly. I have a
  large farm, with ever so many horses, and a fine <i>baan</i> of cows, and
  you could hardly count the sheep and pigs. I'd be as happy as the days
  are long now, James, only for one thing that's often troubling me; and
  that is, to think that my poor old father and mother are in hell.'</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">SWEARING.</p>

  <p>The general run of our people do not swear much; and those that do
  commonly limit themselves to the name of the devil either straight out or
  in some of its various disguised forms, or to some harmless imitation of
  a curse. You do indeed come across persons who go higher, but they are
  rare. Yet while keeping themselves generally within safe bounds, it must
  be confessed that many of the people have a sort of sneaking
  admiration&mdash;lurking secretly and seldom expressed in words&mdash;for
  a good well-balanced curse, so long as it does not shock by its
  profanity. I once knew a doctor&mdash;not in <!-- Page 67 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>{67}</span>Dublin&mdash;who, it
  might be said, was a genius in this line. He could, on the spur of the
  moment, roll out a magnificent curse that might vie with a passage of the
  Iliad in the mouth of Homer. 'Oh sir'&mdash;as I heard a fellow
  say&mdash;''tis grand to listen to him when he's in a rage.' He was known
  as a skilled physician, and a good fellow in every way, and his splendid
  swearing crowned his popularity. He had discretion however, and knew when
  to swear and when not; but ultimately he swore his way into an extensive
  and lucrative practice, which lasted during his whole life&mdash;a long
  and honourable one.</p>

  <p>Parallel to this is Maxwell's account of the cursing of Major Denis
  O'Farrell&mdash;'the Mad Major,' who appears to have been a dangerous
  rival to my acquaintance, the doctor. He was once directing the
  evolutions at a review in presence of Sir Charles, the General, when one
  important movement was spoiled by the blundering of an incompetent little
  adjutant. In a towering passion the Mad Major addressed the
  General:&mdash;'Stop, Sir Charles, do stop; just allow me two minutes to
  curse that rascally adjutant.' To so reasonable a request (Maxwell goes
  on to say), Sir Charles readily assented. He heard the whole malediction
  out, and speaking of it afterwards, he said that 'he never heard a man
  cursed to his perfect satisfaction until he heard (that adjutant)
  anathematised in the Phoenix Park.'</p>

  <p>The Mad Major was a great favourite; and when he died, there was not a
  dry eye in the regiment on the day of the funeral. Two months afterwards
  when an Irish soldier was questioned on the merits of his
  successor:&mdash;'The man is well enough,' said Pat, <!-- Page 68
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>{68}</span>with a heavy
  sigh, 'but where will we find the equal of the Major? By japers, it was a
  comfort to be cursed by him!' ('Wild Sports of the West.')</p>

  <p>In my part of the country there is&mdash;or was&mdash;a legend&mdash;a
  very circumstantial one too&mdash;which however I am not able to verify
  personally, as the thing occurred a little before my time&mdash;that
  Father Buckley, of Glenroe, cured Charley Coscoran, the greatest swearer
  in the barony&mdash;cured him in a most original way. He simply directed
  him to cut out a button from some part of his dress, no matter
  where&mdash;<i>to whip it out on the instant</i>&mdash;every time he
  uttered a serious curse, i.e, one involving the Sacred Name. Charley made
  the promise with a light heart, thinking that by only using a little
  caution he could easily avoid snipping off his buttons. But inveterate
  habit is strong. Only very shortly after he had left the priest he saw a
  cow in one of his cornfields playing havoc: out came a round curse, and
  off came a button on the spot. For Charley was a manly fellow, with a
  real sense of religion at bottom: and he had no notion of shirking his
  penance. Another curse after some time and another button. Others again
  followed:&mdash;coat, waistcoat, trousers, shirt-collar, were brought
  under contribution till his clothes began to fall off him. For a needle
  and thread were not always at hand, and at any rate Charley was no great
  shakes at the needle. At last things came to that pass with poor Charley,
  that life was hardly worth living; till he had to put his mind seriously
  to work, and by careful watching he gradually cured himself. But many
  score buttons passed through his hands during the process. <!-- Page 69
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>{69}</span></p>

  <p>Most persons have a sort of craving or instinct to utter a curse of
  some kind&mdash;as a sort of comforting interjection&mdash;where there is
  sufficient provocation; and in order to satisfy this without incurring
  the guilt, people have invented ejaculations in the form of curses, but
  still harmless. Most of them have some resemblance in sound to the
  forbidden word&mdash;they are near enough to satisfy the craving, but
  still far enough off to avoid the guilt: the process may in fact be
  designated <i>dodging a curse</i>. Hence we have such blank cartridges as
  <i>begob</i>, <i>begor</i>, by my <i>sowkins</i>, by <i>Jove</i>, by the
  <i>laws</i> [Lord], by <i>herrings</i> [heavens], by <i>this and by
  that</i>, <i>dang</i> it, &amp;c.; all of them ghosts of curses, which
  are very general among our people. The following additional examples will
  sufficiently illustrate this part of our subject.</p>

  <p>The expression <i>the dear knows</i> (or correctly <i>the deer
  knows</i>), which is very common, is a translation from Irish of one of
  those substitutions. The original expression is <i>thauss ag Dhee</i>
  [given here phonetically], meaning <i>God knows</i>; but as this is too
  solemn and profane for most people, they changed it to <i>Thauss ag
  fee</i>, i.e. <i>the deer knows</i>; and this may be uttered by anyone.
  <i>Dia</i> [Dhee] God: <i>fiadh</i> [fee], a deer.</p>

  <p>Says Barney Broderick, who is going through his penance after
  confession at the station, and is interrupted by a woman asking him a
  question:&mdash;'Salvation seize your soul&mdash;God forgive me for
  cursing&mdash;be off out of that and don't set me astray!'
  ('Knocknagow.') Here the substitution has turned a wicked imprecation
  into a benison: for the first word in the original is not
  <i>salvation</i> but <i>damnation</i>. <!-- Page 70 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>{70}</span></p>

  <p>'By the hole in my coat,' which is often heard, is regarded as a
  harmless oath: for if there is no hole you are swearing by nothing: and
  if there is a hole&mdash;still the hole is nothing.</p>

  <p>'Bad manners to you,' a mild imprecation, to avoid 'bad luck to you,'
  which would be considered wicked: reflecting the people's horror of rude
  or offensive manners.</p>

  <p>'By all the goats in Kerry,' which I have often heard, is always said
  in joke, which takes the venom out of it. In Leinster they say, 'by all
  the goats in Gorey'&mdash;which is a big oath. Whether it is a big oath
  now or not, I do not know; but it was so formerly, for the name
  <i>Gorey</i> (Wexford), like the Scotch <i>Gowrie</i>, means 'swarming
  with goats.'</p>

  <p>'Man,' says the pretty mermaid to Dick Fitzgerald, when he had
  captured her from the sea, 'man will you eat me?' '<i>By all the red
  petticoats and check aprons between Dingle and Tralee</i>,' cried Dick,
  jumping up in amazement, 'I'd as soon eat myself, my jewel! Is it I to
  eat you, my pet!' (Crofton Croker.)</p>

  <p>'Where did he get the whiskey?' 'Sorrow a know I know,' said Leary.
  'Sorrow fly away with him.' (Crofton Croker.) In these and such
  like&mdash;which you often hear&mdash;<i>sorrow</i> is a substitute for
  <i>devil</i>.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most general exclamations of this kind among Irish people
  are <i>begor</i>, <i>begob</i>, <i>bedad</i>, <i>begad</i> (often
  contracted to <i>egad</i>), <i>faith</i> and <i>troth</i>. <i>Faith</i>,
  contracted from <i>in faith</i> or <i>i' faith</i>, is looked upon by
  many people as not quite harmless: it is a little too serious to be used
  indiscriminately&mdash;'Faith I feel this day very cold': 'Is that tea
  good?' <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page71"></a>{71}</span>'Faith it is no such thing: it is very
  weak.' 'Did Mick sell his cows to-day at the fair?' 'Faith I don't know.'
  People who shrink from the plain word often soften it to <i>faix</i> or
  <i>haith</i> (or <i>heth</i> in Ulster). An intelligent contributor makes
  the remark that the use of this word <i>faith</i> (as above) is a sure
  mark of an Irishman all over the world.</p>

  <p>Even some of the best men will occasionally, in an unguarded moment or
  in a hasty flash of anger, give way to the swearing instinct. Father John
  Burke of Kilfinane&mdash;I remember him well&mdash;a tall stern-looking
  man with heavy brows, but really gentle and tender-hearted&mdash;held a
  station at the house of our neighbour Tom Coffey, a truly upright and
  pious man. All had gone to confession and Holy Communion, and the station
  was over. Tom went out to bring the priest's horse from the paddock, but
  in leading him through a gap in the hedge the horse stood stock still and
  refused obstinately to go an inch farther. Tom pulled and tugged to no
  purpose, till at last his patience went to pieces, and he flung this, in
  no gentle voice, at the animal's head:&mdash;'Blast your <i>sowl</i> will
  you come on!' Just then unluckily Father Burke walked up behind: he had
  witnessed and heard all, and you may well say that Tom's heart dropped
  down into his shoes; for he felt thoroughly ashamed. The crime was not
  great; but it looked bad and unbecoming under the circumstances; and what
  could the priest do but perform his duty: so the black brows contracted,
  and on the spot he gave poor Tom <i>down-the-banks</i> and no mistake. I
  was at that station, though I did not witness the horse scene. <!-- Page
  72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>{72}</span></p>

  <p>If a person pledges himself to anything, clinching the promise with an
  adjuration however mild or harmless, he will not by any means break the
  promise, considering it in a manner as a vow. The old couple are at tea
  and have just one egg, which causes a mild dispute. At last the father
  says decisively&mdash;'The divel a bit of it I'll eat, so there's an end
  of it': when the mother instantly and with great solemnity&mdash;'<span
  class="sc">Faith</span> I won't eat it&mdash;there now!' The result was
  that neither would touch it; and they gave it to their little boy who
  demolished it without the least scruple.</p>

  <p>I was one time a witness of a serio-comic scene <i>on the head of</i>
  one of these blank oaths when I was a small boy attending a very small
  school. The master was a truly good and religious man, but very severe (a
  <i>wicked</i> master, as we used to say), and almost insane in his
  aversion to swearing in any shape or form. To say <i>begob</i> or
  <i>begor</i> or <i>by Jove</i> was unpardonably wicked; it was nothing
  better than blindfolding the devil in the dark.</p>

  <p>One day Jack Aimy, then about twelve years of age&mdash;<i>the
  saint</i> as we used to call him&mdash;for he was always in mischief and
  always in trouble&mdash;said exultingly to the boy sitting next
  him:&mdash;'Oh <i>by the hokey</i>, Tom, I have my sum finished all right
  at last.' In evil hour for him the master happened to be standing just
  behind his back; and then came the deluge. In an instant the school work
  was stopped, and poor Jack was called up to stand before the judgment
  seat. There he got a long lecture&mdash;with the usual
  quotations&mdash;as severe and solemn as if he were a man and had
  perjured himself half a <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page73"></a>{73}</span>dozen times. As for the rest of us, we sat
  in the deadly silence shivering in our skins; for we all, to a man, had a
  guilty consciousness that we were quite as bad as Jack, if the truth were
  known. Then poor Jack was sent to his seat so wretched and crestfallen
  after his lecture that a crow wouldn't pick his bones.</p>

  <p>'By the hokey' is to this day common all over Ireland.</p>

  <p>When we, Irish, go abroad, we of course bring with us our
  peculiarities and mannerisms&mdash;with now and then a little meteoric
  flash of eccentricity&mdash;which on the whole prove rather attractive to
  foreigners, including Englishmen. One Sunday during the South African
  war, Mass was celebrated as usual in the temporary chapel, which, after
  the rough and ready way of the camp, served for both Catholics and
  Protestants: Mass first; Protestant Service after. On this occasion an
  Irish officer, a splendid specimen of a man, tall, straight, and
  athletic&mdash;a man born to command, and well known as a strict and
  devoted Catholic&mdash;was serving Mass&mdash;aiding and giving the
  responses to the priest. The congregation was of course of mixed
  nationalities&mdash;English, Irish, and Scotch, and the chapel was
  filled. Just outside the chapel door a nigger had charge of the big bell
  to call the congregations. On this day, in blissful ignorance and
  indifference, he began to ring for the Protestant congregation too
  soon&mdash;while Mass was still going on&mdash;so as greatly to disturb
  the people at their devotions. The officer was observed to show signs of
  impatience, growing more and more restless as the ringing went <!-- Page
  74 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"></a>{74}</span>on
  persistently, till at last one concentrated series of bangs burst up his
  patience utterly. Starting up from his knees during a short interval when
  his presence was not required&mdash;it happened to be after the most
  solemn part of the Mass&mdash;he strode down the middle passage in a
  mighty rage&mdash;to the astonishment of everybody&mdash;till he got to
  the door, and letting fly&mdash;in the midst of the perfect
  silence,&mdash;a tremendous volley of <i>damns</i>, <i>blasts</i>,
  <i>scoundrels</i>, <i>blackguards</i>, &amp;c., &amp;c., at the head of
  the terrified nigger, he shut him up, himself and his bell, while a cat
  would be licking her ear. He then walked back and resumed his duties,
  calm and collected, and evidently quite unconscious that there was
  anything unusual in the proceeding.</p>

  <p>The whole thing was so sudden and odd that the congregation were
  convulsed with suppressed silent laughter; and I am afraid that some
  people observed even the priest's sides shaking in spite of all he could
  do.</p>

  <p>This story was obtained from a person who was present at that very
  Mass; and it is given here almost in his own words.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">GRAMMAR AND PRONUNCIATION.</p>

  <p><i>Shall</i> and <i>Will</i>. It has been pretty clearly shown that
  the somewhat anomalous and complicated niceties in the English use of
  <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i> have been developed within the last 300
  years or so. It is of course well known that our Irish popular manner of
  using these <!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page75"></a>{75}</span>two particles is not in accordance with the
  present correct English standard; yet most of our shall-and-will
  Hibernianisms represent the classical usage of two or three centuries
  ago: so that this is one of those Irish 'vulgarisms' that are really
  survivals in Ireland of the correct old English usages, which in England
  have been superseded by other and often incorrect forms. On this point I
  received, some years ago, a contribution from an English gentleman who
  resided long in Ireland, Mr. Marlow Woollett, a man of wide reading,
  great culture, and sound judgment. He gives several old examples in
  illustration, of which one is so much to the point&mdash;in the use of
  <i>will</i>&mdash;that you might imagine the words were spoken by an
  Irish peasant of the present day. Hamlet says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>'I will win for him an (if) I can; if not I <i>will</i> gain nothing
  but my shame and the odd hits.' ('Hamlet,' Act v., scene ii.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This (the second <i>will</i>) exactly corresponds with what many of us
  in Ireland would say now:&mdash;'I will win the race if I can; if not I
  <i>will</i> get some discredit': 'If I go without my umbrella I am afraid
  I will get wet.' So also in regard to <i>shall</i>; modern English custom
  has departed from correct ancient usage and etymology, which in many
  cases we in Ireland have retained. The old and correct sense of
  <i>shall</i> indicated obligation or duty (as in Chaucer:&mdash;'The
  faith I shal to God') being derived from A.S. <i>sceal</i> 'I owe' or
  'ought': this has been discarded in England, while we still retain it in
  our usage in Ireland. You say to an attentive Irish waiter, 'Please have
  breakfast for me at 8 o'clock to-morrow morning'; and he answers, 'I
  shall sir.' When I was a boy I was <!-- Page 76 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>{76}</span>present in the chapel of
  Ardpatrick one Sunday, when Father Dan O'Kennedy, after Mass, called on
  the two schoolmasters&mdash;candidates for a school vacancy&mdash;to come
  forward to him from where they stood at the lower end of the chapel; when
  one of them, Mat Rea, a good scholar but a terrible pedant, called out
  magniloquently, 'Yes, doctor, we <span class="scac">SHALL</span> go to
  your reverence,' unconsciously following in the footsteps of
  Shakespeare.</p>

  <p>The language both of the waiter and of Mat Rea is exactly according to
  the old English usage.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'<i>Lady Macbeth</i> (<i>to Macbeth</i>):&mdash;Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'<i>Macbeth</i>:&mdash;So shall I, love.' ('Macbeth,' Act iii. scene ii.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'<i>Second Murderer</i>:&mdash;We shall, my lord,</p>
      <p class="i6">Perform what you command us.' (<i>Ibid.</i>, Act iii. scene i.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But the Irish waiter's answer would now seem strange to an Englishman.
  To him, instead of being a dutiful assent, as it is intended to be, and
  as it would be in England in old times, it would look too emphatic and
  assertive, something like as if it were an answer to a command <i>not</i>
  to do it. (Woollett.)</p>

  <p>The use of <i>shall</i> in such locutions was however not universal in
  Shakespearian times, as it would be easy to show; but the above
  quotations&mdash;and others that might be brought forward&mdash;prove
  that this usage then prevailed and was correct, which is sufficient for
  my purpose. Perhaps it might rather be said that <i>shall</i> and
  <i>will</i> were used in such cases indifferently:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'<i>Queen</i>:&mdash;Say to the king, I would attend his leisure</p>
      <p>For a few words.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'<i>Servant</i>: Madam, I will.'    ('Macbeth,' Act iii. scene ii.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"></a>{77}</span></p>

  <p>Our use of <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i> prevails also in Scotland,
  where the English change of custom has not obtained any more than it has
  in Ireland. The Scotch in fact are quite as bad (or as good) in this
  respect as we are. Like many another Irish idiom this is also found in
  American society chiefly through the influence of the Irish. In many
  parts of Ireland they are shy of using <i>shall</i> at all: I know this
  to be the case in Munster; and a correspondent informs me that
  <i>shall</i> is hardly ever heard in Derry.</p>

  <p>The incorrect use of <i>will</i> in questions in the first person
  singular ('Will I light the fire ma'am?' 'Will I sing you a
  song?'&mdash;instead of 'Shall I?') appears to have been developed in
  Ireland independently, and not derived from any former correct usage: in
  other words we have created this incorrect locution&mdash;or
  vulgarism&mdash;for ourselves. It is one of our most general and most
  characteristic speech errors. <i>Punch</i> represents an Irish waiter
  with hand on dish-cover, asking:&mdash;'Will I sthrip ma'am?'</p>

  <p>What is called the <i>regular</i> formation of the past tense (in
  <i>ed</i>) is commonly known as the weak inflection:&mdash;<i>call,
  called</i>: the <i>irregular</i> formation (by changing the vowel) is the
  strong inflection:&mdash;<i>run, ran</i>. In old English the strong
  inflection appears to have been almost universal; but for some hundreds
  of years the English tendency is to replace strong by weak inflection.
  But our people in Ireland, retaining the old English custom, have a
  leaning towards the strong inflection, and not only use many of the
  old-fashioned English strong past tenses, but often form strong ones in
  their own way:&mdash;We use <i>slep</i> and <i>crep</i>, old English; and
  we coin others. 'He <i>ruz</i> his hand <!-- Page 78 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>{78}</span>to me,' 'I <i>cotch</i>
  him stealing the turf,' 'he <i>gother</i> sticks for the fire,' 'he
  <i>hot</i> me on the head with his stick,' he <i>sot</i> down on the
  chair' (very common in America). Hyland, the farm manager, is sent with
  some bullocks to the fair; and returns. 'Well Hyland, are the bullocks
  sold?'&mdash;'Sowld and <i>ped</i> for sir.' <i>Wor</i> is very usual in
  the south for <i>were</i>: 'tis long since we <i>wor</i> on the road so
  late as this.' (Knocknagow.)</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'<i>Wor</i> you at the fair&mdash;did you see the wonder&mdash;</p>
      <p>Did you see Moll Roe riding on the gander?'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>E'er</i> and <i>ne'er</i> are in constant use in
  Munster:&mdash;'Have you e'er a penny to give me sir? No, I have ne'er a
  penny for you this time.' Both of these are often met with in
  Shakespeare.</p>

  <p>The Irish schoolmasters knew Irish well, and did their
  best&mdash;generally with success&mdash;to master English. This they did
  partly from their neighbours, but in a large measure from books,
  including dictionaries. As they were naturally inclined to show forth
  their learning, they made use, as much as possible, of long and unusual
  words, mostly taken from dictionaries, but many coined by themselves from
  Latin. Goldsmith's description of the village master with his 'words of
  learned length and thundering sound,' applies exactly to a large
  proportion of the schoolmasters of the eighteenth and first half of the
  nineteenth century all over Ireland. You heard these words often in
  conversation, but the schoolmasters most commonly used them in
  song-writing. Here also they made free use of the classical mythology;
  but I will not touch on this <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page79"></a>{79}</span>feature, as I have treated of it, and have
  given specimens, in my 'Old Irish Folk Music and Songs,' pp. 200-202.</p>

  <p>As might be expected, the schoolmasters, as well as others, who used
  these strange words often made mistakes in applying them; which will be
  seen in some of the following examples. Here is one whole verse of a song
  about a young lady&mdash;'The Phoenix of the Hall.'</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'I being quite captivated and so infatuated</p>
      <p>I then prognosticated my sad forlorn case;</p>
      <p>But I quickly ruminated&mdash;suppose I was <i>defaited</i>,</p>
      <p>I would not be implicated or treated with disgrace;</p>
      <p>So therefore I awaited with my spirits elevated,</p>
      <p>And no more I ponderated let what would me befall;</p>
      <p>I then to her <i>repated</i> how Cupid had me <i>thrated</i>,</p>
      <p>And thus expostulated with The Phoenix of the Hall.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In another verse of this song the poet tells us what he might do for
  the Phoenix if he had greater command of language:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Could I indite like Homer that celebrated <i>pomer</i>.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>One of these schoolmasters, whom I knew, composed a poem in praise of
  Queen Victoria just after her accession, of which I remember only two
  lines:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'In England our queen resides with <i>alacrity</i>,</p>
      <p>With civil authority and kind urbanity.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Another opens his song in this manner:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'One morning serene as I roved in solitude,</p>
      <p>Viewing the magnitude of th' orient ray.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The author of the song in praise of Castlehyde speaks of</p>

  <p>But endless examples of this kind might be given.</p>

  <p>Occasionally you will find the peasantry attempting long or unusual

  <p>Sometimes the simple past tense is used for one of the subjunctive

  <p><i>See</i> is very often used for <i>saw</i>:&mdash;'Did you ever see
  a cluricaun Molly?' 'Oh no sir, I never see one myself.' (Crofton
  Croker.) 'Come here Nelly, and point out the bride to us.' 'I never see
  her myself Miss' [so I don't know her] replied Nelly. (Knocknagow.) This
  is a survival from old English, in which it was very common. It is
  moreover general among the English peasantry at the present day, as may
  be seen everywhere in Dickens.</p>

  <p>The imperative of verbs is often formed by <i>let</i>:&mdash;instead
  of 'go to the right 'or 'go you to the right,' our people say 'let you go
  to the right': 'let you look after the cows and I will see to the
  horses.' A fellow is arrested for a crime and dares the police
  with:&mdash;'Let ye prove it.'</p>

  <p>In Derry porridge or stirabout always takes the plural: 'Have you
  dished <i>them</i> yet?'</p>

  <p>'I didn't go to the fair <i>'cause why</i>, the day was too wet.' This
  expression <i>'cause why</i>, which is very often heard in Ireland, is
  English at least 500 years old: for we find it in Chaucer.</p>

  <p>You often hear <i>us</i> for <i>me</i>: 'Give us a penny sir to buy
  sweets' (i.e. 'Give me').</p>

  <p>In Waterford and South Wexford the people often use such verbal forms
  as is seen in the following:&mdash;'Does your father grow wheat still?'
  'He <i>do</i>.' 'Has he the old white horse now?' 'He <i>have</i>.' As to
  <i>has</i>, Mr. MacCall states that it is unknown in the barony of Forth:
  there you always hear 'that man <i>have</i> plenty of money'&mdash;he
  <i>have</i>&mdash;she <i>have</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The Rev. William Burke tells us that <i>have</i> is found as above (a
  third person singular) all through the old Waterford Bye-Laws; which
  would render it <!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page82"></a>{82}</span>pretty certain that both <i>have</i> and
  <i>do</i> in these applications are survivals from the old English colony
  in Waterford and Wexford.</p>

  <p>In Donegal and thereabout <i>the yon</i> is often shortened to
  <i>thon</i>, which is used as equivalent to <i>that</i> or <i>those</i>:
  'you may take <i>thon</i> book.'</p>

  <p>In Donegal 'such a thing' is often made <i>such an a thing</i>.' I
  have come across this several times: but the following quotation is
  decisive&mdash;'No, Dinny O'Friel, I don't want to make you say any such
  an a thing.' (Seamus MacManus.)</p>

  <p>There is a tendency to put <i>o</i> at the end of some words, such as
  boy-o, lad-o. A fellow was tried for sheep-stealing before the late Judge
  Monahan, and the jury acquitted him, very much against the evidence. 'You
  may go now,' said the judge, 'as you are acquitted; but you stole the
  sheep all the same, my buck-o.'</p>

  <p>This is found in Irish also, as in '<i>a vick-o</i>' ('my boy,' or
  more exactly 'my son,' where <i>vick</i> is <i>mhic</i>, vocative of
  <i>mac</i>, son) heard universally in Munster: 'Well Billy a vick-o, how
  is your mother this morning?' I suppose the English practice is borrowed
  from the Irish.</p>

  <p>In Irish there is only one article, <i>an</i>, which is equivalent to
  the English definite article <i>the</i>. This article (<i>an</i>) is much
  more freely used in Irish than <i>the</i> is in English, a practice which
  we are inclined to imitate in our Anglo-Irish speech. Our use of
  <i>the</i> <!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page83"></a>{83}</span>often adds a sort of emphasis to the noun or
  adjective:&mdash;'Ah John was the man,' i.e. the real man, a man
  pre-eminent for some quality&mdash;bravery, generosity, &amp;c. 'Ah that
  was the trouble in earnest.' The Irish chiefs of long ago 'were the men
  in the gap' (Thomas Davis):&mdash;i.e. the real men and no mistake. We
  often use the article in our speech where it would not be used in correct
  English:&mdash;'I am perished with <i>the</i> cold.' 'I don't know much
  Greek, but I am good at <i>the</i> Latin.'</p>

  <p>'That was the dear journey to me.' A very common form of expression,
  signifying that 'I paid dearly for it'&mdash;'it cost me dear.' Hugh
  Reynolds when about to be hanged for attempting the abduction of
  Catherine McCabe composes (or is supposed to compose) his 'Lamentation,'
  of which the verses end in 'She's the dear maid to me.' (See my 'Old
  Irish Folk Music and Songs,' p. 135.) A steamer was in danger of running
  down a boat rowed by one small boy on the Shannon. 'Get out of the way
  you young rascal or we'll run over you and drown you!' Little Jacky looks
  up defiantly and cries out:&mdash;'Ye'll drownd me, will ye: if ye do,
  I'll make it the dear drownding to ye!' In such expressions it is however
  to be observed that the indefinite article <i>a</i> is often
  used&mdash;perhaps as often as <i>the</i>:&mdash;'That was a dear
  transaction for me.' 'Oh, green-hilled pleasant Erin you're a dear land
  to me!' (Robert Dwyer Joyce's 'Ballads of Irish Chivalry,' p. 206.)</p>

  <p>In Ulster they say:&mdash;'When are you going?' 'Oh I am going <i>the
  day</i>,' i.e. to-day. I am much better <i>the day</i> than I was
  yesterday. In this <i>the day</i> <!-- Page 84 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page84"></a>{84}</span>is merely a translation
  of the Irish word for to-day&mdash;<i>andiu</i>, where <i>an</i> is 'the'
  and <i>diu</i> a form of the Irish for 'day.'</p>

  <p>The use of the singular of nouns instead of the plural after a numeral
  is found all through Ireland. Tom Cassidy our office porter&mdash;a
  Westmeath man&mdash;once said to me 'I'm in this place now forty-four
  year': and we always use such expressions as <i>nine head of cattle</i>.
  A friend of mine, a cultivated and scholarly clergyman, always used
  phrases like 'that bookcase cost thirteen <i>pound</i>.' This is an old
  English survival. Thus in Macbeth we find 'this three mile.' But I think
  this phraseology has also come partly under the influence of our Gaelic
  in which <i>ten</i> and numerals that are multiples of <i>ten</i> always
  take the singular of nouns, as <i>tri-caogad laoch</i>, 'thrice fifty
  heroes'&mdash;lit. 'thrice fifty <i>hero</i>.'</p>

  <p>In the south of Ireland <i>may</i> is often incorrectly used for
  <i>might</i>, even among educated people:&mdash;'Last week when setting
  out on my long train journey, I brought a book that I <i>may</i> read as
  I travelled along.' I have heard and read, scores of times, expressions
  of which this is a type&mdash;not only among the peasantry, but from
  newspaper correspondents, professors, &amp;c.&mdash;and you can hear and
  read them from Munstermen to this day in Dublin.</p>

  <p>In Ulster <i>till</i> is commonly used instead of <i>to</i>:&mdash;'I
  am going <i>till</i> Belfast to-morrow': in like manner <i>until</i> is
  used for <i>unto</i>.</p>

  <p>There are two tenses in English to which there is nothing
  corresponding in Irish:&mdash;what is sometimes called the
  perfect&mdash;'I <i>have finished</i> my work'; and the
  pluperfect&mdash;'I <i>had finished</i> my work' [before you <!-- Page 85
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>{85}</span>arrived]. The
  Irish people in general do not use&mdash;or know how to use&mdash;these
  in their English speech; but they feel the want of them, and use various
  expedients to supply their places. The most common of these is the use of
  the word <i>after</i> (commonly with a participle) following the verb
  <i>to be</i>. Thus instead of the perfect, as expressed above, they will
  say 'I am after finishing my work,' 'I am after my supper.'
  ('Knocknagow.') 'I'm after getting the lend of an American paper'
  (<i>ibid.</i>); and instead of the pluperfect (as above) they will say 'I
  was after finishing my work' [before you arrived]. Neither of these two
  expressions would be understood by an Englishman, although they are
  universal in Ireland, even among the higher and educated classes.</p>

  <p>This word <i>after</i> in such constructions is merely a translation
  of the Irish <i>iar</i> or <i>a n-diaigh</i>&mdash;for both are used in
  corresponding expressions in Irish.</p>

  <p>But this is only one of the expedients for expressing the perfect
  tense. Sometimes they use the simple past tense, which is ungrammatical,
  as our little newsboy in Kilkee used to do: 'Why haven't you brought me
  the paper?' 'The paper didn't come from the station yet sir.' Sometimes
  the present progressive is used, which also is bad grammar: 'I am sitting
  here waiting for you for the last hour' (instead of 'I have been
  sitting'). Occasionally the <i>have</i> or <i>has</i> of the perfect (or
  the <i>had</i> of the pluperfect) is taken very much in its primary sense
  of having or possessing. Instead of 'You have quite distracted me with
  your talk,' the people will say 'You have me quite distracted,' &amp;c.:
  <!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"></a>{86}</span>'I
  have you found out at last.' 'The children had me vexed.' (Jane
  Barlow.)</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>(See my Old Irish Folk Music and Songs, p. 208.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Corresponding devices are resorted to for the pluperfect. Sometimes
  the simple past is used where the pluperfect ought to come in:&mdash;'An
  hour before you came yesterday I finished my work': where it should be 'I
  had finished.' Anything to avoid the pluperfect, which the people cannot
  manage.</p>

  <p>In the Irish language (but not in English) there is what is called the
  consuetudinal tense, i.e. denoting habitual action or existence. It is a
  very convenient tense, so much so that the Irish, feeling the want of it
  in their English, have created one by the use of the word <i>do</i> with
  <i>be</i>: 'I do be at my lessons every evening from 8 to 9 o'clock.'
  'There does be a meeting of the company every Tuesday.' ''Tis humbuggin'
  me they <i>do be</i>.' ('Knocknagow.')</p>

  <p>Sometimes this is expressed by <i>be</i> alone without the <i>do</i>;
  but here the <i>be</i> is also often used in the ordinary sense of
  <i>is</i> without any consuetudinal meaning. 'My father <i>bees</i>
  always at home in the morning': 'At night while I <i>bees</i> reading my
  wife bees knitting.' (Consuetudinal.) 'You had better not wait till it
  bees night.' (Indicative.)</p>

    </div>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>{87}</span></p>

  <p>This use of <i>be</i> for <i>is</i> is common in the eastern half of
  Ireland from Wexford to Antrim.</p>

  <p>Such old forms as <i>anear</i>, <i>adown</i>, <i>afeard</i>,
  <i>apast</i>, <i>afore</i>, &amp;c., are heard everywhere in Ireland, and
  are all of old English origin, as it would be easy to show by quotations
  from English classical writers. 'If my child was standing <i>anear</i>
  that stone.' (Gerald Griffin: 'Collegians.') 'She was never a-shy or
  ashamed to show' [her respect for me]. ('Knocknagow.') The above words
  are considered vulgar by our educated people: yet many others remain
  still in correct English, such as <i>aboard</i>, <i>afoot</i>,
  <i>amidst</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>I think it likely that the Irish language has had some influence in
  the adoption and retention of those old English words; for we have in
  Irish a group of words identical with them both in meaning and structure:
  such as <i>a-n-aice</i> (a-near), where <i>aice</i> is 'near.' (The
  <i>n</i> comes in for a grammatical reason.)</p>

  <p>'I be to do it' in Ulster is used to express 'I have to do it': 'I am
  bound to do it'; 'it is destined that I shall do it.' 'I be to remain
  here till he calls,' I am bound to remain. 'The only comfort I have
  [regarding some loss sure to come on] is that it be to be,' i.e. that 'it
  is fated to be'&mdash;'it is <i>unavoidable</i>.' 'What bees to be maun
  be' (must be).</p>

  <p>Father William Burke points out that we use 'every other' in two
  different senses. He remains at home always on Monday, but goes to town
  'every other' day&mdash;meaning every day of the week except Monday:
  which is the most usual application among us. 'My father goes to town
  every other day,' i.e. <!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page88"></a>{88}</span>every alternate day. This last is rarely
  used by our people, who prefer to express it 'My father goes to town
  <i>every second day</i>.' Of two persons it is stated:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'You'd like to see them drinking from one cup,</p>
      <p>They took so loving <i>every second sup</i>.'</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>(Old Irish Folk Song.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The simple phrase 'the other day' means a few days ago. 'When did you
  see your brother John?' 'Oh I saw him the other day.'</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'The other day he sailed away and parted his dear Nancy.'</p>

  <p>The dropping of <i>thou</i> was a distinct loss to the English
  language: for now <i>you</i> has to do double duty&mdash;for both
  singular and plural&mdash;which sometimes leads to obscurity. The Irish
  try to avoid this obscurity by various devices. They always use <i>ye</i>
  in the plural whenever possible: both as a nominative and as an
  objective: 'Where are ye going to-day?' 'I'm afeard that will be a dear
  journey to ye.' Accepting the <i>you</i> as singular, they have created
  new forms for the plural such as <i>yous</i>, <i>yez</i>, <i>yiz</i>,
  which do not sound pleasant to a correct speaker, but are very clear in
  sense. In like manner they form a possessive case direct on <i>ye</i>.

  at any rate. I'm laughing at the way we'll carry out <i>yeer</i> song

  Similarly '<i>weer</i> own' is sometimes used for 'our own.' <!-- Page 89
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"></a>{89}</span></p>

  <p>The distributive <i>every</i> requires to be followed by pronouns in
  the singular: but this rule is broken even by well-known English
  writers:&mdash;'Every one for themselves' occurs in Robinson Crusoe; and
  in Ireland plurals are almost universally used. '<i>Let every one mind
  themselves</i> as the ass said when he leaped into a flock of
  chickens.'</p>

  <p>Father Burke has shown&mdash;a matter that had escaped me&mdash;that
  we often use the verbs <i>rest</i> and <i>perish</i> in an active sense.
  The first is seen in the very general Irish prayer 'God rest his soul.'
  Mangan uses the word in this sense in the Testament of Cathaeir
  Mór:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

  <p><i>Perish</i> is quoted below in the saying&mdash;'That breeze would
  perish the Danes.'</p>

  <p>We have many intensive words, some used locally, some
  generally:&mdash;'This is a <i>cruel</i> wet day'; 'that old fellow is
  <i>cruel</i> rich': that's a <i>cruel</i> good man (where <i>cruel</i> in
  all means <i>very</i>: Ulster). 'That girl is <i>fine and fat</i>: her
  cheeks are <i>fine and red</i>.' 'I was <i>dead fond</i> of her' (very
  fond): but <i>dead certain</i> occurs in 'Bleak House.' 'That tree has a
  <i>mighty</i> great load of apples.' 'I want a drink badly; my throat is
  <i>powerful</i> dry.' ('Shanahan's Ould Shebeen,' New York.) 'John Cusack
  is the finest dancer <i>at all</i>.' 'This day is <i>mortal</i> cold.'
  'I'm <i>black out</i> with you.' <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page90"></a>{90}</span>'I'm very glad <i>entirely</i> to hear it.'
  'He is very sick <i>entirely</i>.' This word <i>entirely</i> is one of
  our most general and characteristic intensives. 'He is a very good man
  <i>all out</i>.' 'This day is <i>guy and</i> wet': 'that boy is <i>guy
  and</i> fat' (Ulster). A half fool of a fellow looking at a four-wheeled
  carriage in motion: 'Aren't the little wheels <i>damn good</i> not to let
  the big wheels overtake them.' In the early days of cycling a young
  friend of mine was riding on a five-foot wheel past two countrymen; when
  one remarked to the other:&mdash;'Tim, that's a <i>gallows</i> way of
  travelling.' 'I was up <i>murdering</i> late last night.' (Crofton
  Croker.)</p>

  <p>In the Irish language there are many diminutive terminations, all
  giving the idea of 'little,' which will be found fully enumerated and
  illustrated in my 'Irish Names of Places,' vol. ii, chap. ii. Of these it
  may be said that only one&mdash;<i>ín</i> or <i>een</i>&mdash;has found
  its way into Ireland's English speech, carrying with it its full sense of
  smallness. There are others&mdash;<i>án</i> or <i>aun</i>, and <i>óg</i>
  or <i>oge</i>; but these have in great measure lost their original
  signification; and although we use them in our Irish-English, they hardly
  convey any separate meaning. But <i>een</i> is used everywhere: it is
  even constantly tacked on to Christian names (especially of boys and
  girls):&mdash;<i>Mickeen</i> (little Mick), <i>Noreen</i>,
  <i>Billeen</i>, <i>Jackeen</i> (a word applied to the conceited little
  Dublin citizen). So also you hear <i>Birdeen</i>,
  <i>Robineen</i>-redbreast, <i>bonniveen</i>, &amp;c. A boy who apes to be
  a man&mdash;puts on airs like a man&mdash;is called a <i>manneen</i> in
  contempt (exactly equivalent to the English <i>mannikin</i>). I knew a
  boy named Tommeen Trassy: and the name stuck to him even when he <!--
  Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"></a>{91}</span>was a
  great big whacker of a fellow six feet high. In the south this diminutive
  is long (<i>een</i>) and takes the accent: in the north it is made short
  (<i>in</i>) and is unaccented.</p>

  <p>It is well known that three hundred years ago, and even much later,
  the correct English sound of the diphthong <i>ea</i> was the same as long
  <i>a</i> in <i>fate</i>: <i>sea</i> pronounced <i>say</i>, &amp;c. Any
  number of instances could be brought together from the English poets in
  illustration of this:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'God moves in a mysterious way,</p>

  <p>This sound has long since been abandoned in England, but is still
  preserved among the Irish people. You will hear everywhere in Ireland, 'a
  pound of <i>mate</i>,' 'a cup of <i>tay</i>,' 'you're as deep as the
  <i>say</i>,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Many years ago I was travelling on the long car from Macroom to
  Killarney. On the other side&mdash;at my back&mdash;sat a young
  gentleman&mdash;a 'superior person,' as anyone could gather from his
  <i>dandified</i> speech. The car stopped where he was to get off: a tall
  fine-looking old gentleman was waiting for him, and nothing could exceed
  the dignity and kindness with which he received him. Pointing to <!--
  Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>{92}</span>his car
  he said 'Come now and they'll get you a nice refreshing cup of

  felt a shrinking of shame for our humanity. Now which of these two was
  the vulgarian?</p>

  <p>The old sound of <i>ea</i> is still retained&mdash;even in
  England&mdash;in the word <i>great</i>; but there was a long contest in
  the English Parliament over this word. Lord Chesterfield adopted the
  affected pronunciation (<i>greet</i>), saying that only an Irishman would
  call it <i>grate</i>. 'Single-speech Hamilton'&mdash;a Dublin
  man&mdash;who was considered, in the English House of Commons, a high
  authority on such matters, stoutly supported <i>grate</i>, and the
  influence of the Irish orators finally turned the scale. (Woollett.)</p>

  <p>A similar statement may be made regarding the diphthong <i>ei</i> and
  long <i>e</i>, that is to say, they were both formerly sounded like long
  <i>a</i> in <i>fate</i>.</p>

  <p>Our people generally retain the old sounds of long <i>e</i> and
  <i>ei</i>; for they say <i>persaive</i> for perceive, and <i>sevare</i>
  for <i>severe</i>.</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>Our Irish way of sounding both <i>ea</i> and long <i>e</i> is
  exemplified in what I heard a man say&mdash;a man who had some knowledge
  of Shakespeare&mdash;about a girl who was becoming somewhat of an old
  maid: 'She's now getting into the <i>sair</i> and <i>yallow
  laif</i>.'</p>

  <p>Observe, the correct old English sound of <i>ie</i> and <i>ee</i> has
  not changed: it is the same at present in England as it was formerly; and
  accordingly the Irish people always sound these correctly. They never say
  <i>praste</i> for priest, <i>belave</i> for believe, <i>indade</i> for
  indeed, or <i>kape</i> for keep, as some ignorant writers set down.</p>

  <p><i>Ate</i> is pronounced <i>et</i> by the educated English. In Munster
  the educated people pronounce it <i>ait</i>: 'Yesterday I <i>ait</i> a
  good dinner'; and when <i>et</i> is heard among the uneducated&mdash;as
  it generally is&mdash;it is considered very vulgar.</p>

  <p>It appears that in correct old English <i>er</i> was sounded
  <i>ar</i>&mdash;Dryden rhymes <i>certain</i> with
  <i>parting</i>&mdash;and this is still retained in correct English in a
  few words, like <i>sergeant</i>, <i>clerk</i>, &amp;c. Our people retain
  the old sound in most such words, as <i>sarvant</i>, <i>marchant</i>,
  <i>sartin</i>. But sometimes in their anxiety to avoid this vulgarity,
  they overdo the refinement: so that you will hear girls talk mincingly
  about <i>derning</i> a stocking. This is like what happened in the case
  of one of our servant girls who took it into her head that <!-- Page 94
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"></a>{94}</span><i>mutton</i>
  was a vulgar way of pronouncing the word, like <i>pudden'</i> for
  <i>pudding</i>; so she set out with her new grand pronunciation; and one
  day rather astonished our butcher by telling him she wanted a small leg
  of <i>mutting</i>. I think this vulgarism is heard among the English
  peasantry too: though we have the honour and glory of evolving it
  independently.</p>

  <p>All over Ireland you will hear the words <i>vault</i> and <i>fault</i>
  sounded <i>vaut</i> and <i>faut</i>. 'If I don't be able to shine it will
  be none of my <i>faut</i>.' (Carleton, as cited by Hume.) We have
  retained this sound from old English:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Let him not dare to vent his dangerous thought:</p>
      <p>A noble fool was never in a <i>fault</i> [faut].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>(<span class="sc">Pope</span>, cited by Hume.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Goldsmith uses this pronunciation more than once; but whether he
  brought it from Ireland or took it from classical English writers, by
  whom it was used (as by Pope) almost down to his time, it is hard to say.
  For instance in 'The Deserted Village' he says of the Village
  Master:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Yet he was kind, or if severe in aught</p>
      <p>The love he bore to learning was in <i>fault</i>' [faut].</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I remember reading many years ago a criticism of Goldsmith by a
  well-known Irish professor of English literature, in which the professor
  makes great fun, as a 'superior person,' of the <i>Hibernicism</i> in the
  above couplet, evidently ignorant of the fact, which Dr. Hume has well
  brought out, that it is classical English. <!-- Page 95 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page95"></a>{95}</span></p>

  <p>In many parts of Munster there is a tendency to give the long <i>a</i>
  the sound of <i>a</i> in <i>car</i>, <i>father</i>:&mdash;</p>

  <p>So, an intelligent peasant,&mdash;a born orator, but illiterate in so
  far as he could neither read nor write,&mdash;told me that he was a
  <i>spectaathor</i> at one of O'Connell's Repeal meetings: and the same
  man, in reply to a strange gentleman's inquiry as to who planted a
  certain wood up the hill, replied that the trees were not
  planted&mdash;they grew <i>spontaan-yus</i>.</p>

  <p>I think this is a remnant of the old classical teaching of Munster:
  though indeed I ought to mention that the same tendency is found in
  Monaghan, where on every possible occasion the people give this sound to
  long <i>a</i>.</p>

  <p><i>D</i> before long <i>u</i> is generally sounded like <i>j</i>; as
  in <i>projuce</i> for <i>produce</i>: the <i>Juke</i> of Wellington,
  &amp;c. Many years ago I knew a fine old gentleman from Galway. He wished
  to make people believe that in the old fighting times, when he was a
  young man, he was a desperate <i>gladiaathor</i>; but he really was a
  gentle creature who never in all his born days hurt man or mortal.
  Talking one day to some workmen in Kildare, and recounting his exploits,
  he told them <!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page96"></a>{96}</span>that he was now <i>harrished</i> every night
  by the ghosts of all the <i>min</i> he killed in <i>juels</i>.</p>

  <p>So <i>s</i> before long <i>u</i> is sounded <i>sh</i>: Dan Kiely, a
  well-to-do young farmer, told the people of our neighbourhood that he was
  now looking out for a wife that would <i>shoot</i> him. This
  pronunciation is however still sometimes heard in words of correct
  English, as in <i>sure</i>.</p>

  <p>There are some consonants of the Irish language which when they come
  together do not coalesce in sound, as they would in an English word, so
  that when they are uttered a very short obscure vowel sound is heard
  between them: and a native Irish speaker cannot avoid this. By a sort of
  hereditary custom this peculiarity finds its way into our pronunciation
  of English. Thus <i>firm</i> is sounded in Ireland
  <i>ferrum</i>&mdash;two distinct syllables: 'that bird is looking for a
  <i>wurrum</i>.' <i>Form</i> (a seat) we call a <i>furrum</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Herb</i> is sounded <i>errub</i>: and we make two syllables of the
  name Charles [Char-less]. At the time of the Bulgarian massacres, I knew
  a Dublin doctor, a Tipperary man, who felt very strongly on the subject
  and was constantly talking about the poor <i>Bullugarians</i>.</p>

  <p>In the County Monaghan and indeed elsewhere <!-- Page 97 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page97"></a>{97}</span>in Ireland, <i>us</i> is
  sounded <i>huz</i>, which might seem a Cockney vulgarism, but I think it
  is not. In Roscommon and in the Munster counties a thong is called a
  <i>fong</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Chaw</i> for <i>chew</i>, <i>oncet</i> [wonst] for <i>once</i>,
  <i>twiced</i> for <i>twice</i>, and <i>heighth</i>, <i>sighth</i>, for
  <i>height</i>, <i>sight</i>, which are common in Ireland, are all old
  English survivals. Thus in the 'Faerie Queene' (Bk. <span
  class="scac">I.</span>, Canto <span class="scac">IV.</span>, <span
  class="scac">XXX.</span>):&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Chaw</i> is also much used in America. '<i>Onst</i> for once, is in
  the Chester Plays' (Lowell); and <i>highth</i> for <i>height</i> is found
  all through 'Paradise Lost.' So also we have <i>drooth</i> for

  <p><i>Joist</i> is sounded <i>joice</i> in Limerick; and <i>catch</i> is
  everywhere pronounced <i>ketch</i>.</p>

  <p>The word <i>hither</i> is pronounced in Ireland <i>hether</i>, which
  is the correct old English usage, but long since abandoned in England.
  Thus in a State Paper of 1598, we read that two captains returned
  <i>hether</i>: and in Spenser's 'View,' he mentions a 'colony [sent]
  <i>hether</i> out of Spaine.'</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p>That <i>hether</i> turns his steps.' ('Faerie Queene.')</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Hence we have coined the word <i>comether</i>, for <i>come-hether</i>,
  to denote a sort of spell brought about <!-- Page 98 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page98"></a>{98}</span>by coaxing, wheedling,
  making love, &amp;c.&mdash;as in the phrase 'she put her <i>comether</i>
  on him, so that he married her up at once.' 'There'll not be six girls in
  the fair he'll not be putting the <i>comether</i> on.' (Seumas
  MacManus.)</p>

  <p>The family name 'Bermingham' is always made <i>Brimmigem</i> in
  Ireland, which is a very old English corruption. In Friar Clyn's Annals
  (Latin) written in the fourteenth century, the death is recorded in 1329
  of Johannes de <i>Brimegham</i>, i.e., the celebrated Sir John Bermingham
  who defeated Edward Bruce at Faughart.</p>

  <p>Leap is pronounced <i>lep</i> by our people; and in racing circles it
  is still so pronounced by all classes. The little village of Leap in the
  County Cork is always called <i>Lep</i>.</p>

  <p>There is a curious tendency among us to reverse the sounds of certain
  letters, as for instance <i>sh</i> and <i>ch</i>. 'When you're coming
  home to-morrow bring the spade and <i>chovel</i>, and a pound of butter
  fresh from the <i>shurn</i>.' 'That <i>shimney</i> doesn't draw the smoke
  well.' So with the letters <i>u</i> and <i>i</i>. 'When I was crossing
  the <i>brudge</i> I dropped the sweeping <i>brish</i> into the
  <i>ruvver</i>.' 'I never saw <i>sich</i> a sight.' But such words are
  used only by the very uneducated. <i>Brudge</i> for <i>bridge</i> and the
  like are however of old English origin. 'Margaret, mother of Henry VII,
  writes <i>seche</i> for <i>such</i>' (Lowell). So in
  Ireland:&mdash;'<i>Jestice</i> is all I ax,' says Mosy in the story ('Ir.
  Pen. Mag.); and <i>churries</i> for <i>cherries</i> ('Knocknagow'). This
  tendency corresponds with the vulgar use of <i>h</i> in London and
  elsewhere in England. 'The 'en has just laid a <i>hegg</i>': 'he was
  singing My 'art's in the <!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page99"></a>{99}</span>'ighlands or The Brave Old <i>Hoak</i>.'
  (Washington Irving.)</p>

  <p><i>Squeeze</i> is pronounced <i>squeedge</i> and <i>crush</i>
  <i>scroodge</i> in Donegal and elsewhere; but corruptions like these are
  found among the English peasantry&mdash;as may be seen in Dickens.</p>

  <p>'You had better <i>rinsh</i> that glass' is heard everywhere in
  Ireland: an old English survival; for Shakespeare and Lovelace have
  <i>renched</i> for <i>rinced</i> (Lowell): which with the Irish sound of
  short <i>e</i> before <i>n</i> gives us our word <i>rinshed</i>.</p>

  <p>Such words as <i>old</i>, <i>cold</i>, <i>hold</i> are pronounced by
  the Irish people <i>ould</i>, <i>cowld</i>, <i>hould</i> (or
  <i>howlt</i>); <i>gold</i> is sounded <i>goold</i> and <i>ford</i>
  <i>foord</i>. I once heard an old Wicklow woman say of some very rich
  people 'why these people could <i>ait goold</i>.' These are all survivals
  of the old English way of pronouncing such words. In the State Papers of
  Elizabeth's time you will constantly meet with such words as <i>hoult</i>
  and <i>stronghowlt</i> (hold and stronghold.) In my boyhood days I knew a
  great large sinewy active woman who lived up in the mountain gap, and who
  was universally known as 'Thunder the <i>cowlt</i> from Poulaflaikeen'
  (<i>cowlt</i> for <i>colt</i>); Poulaflaikeen, the high pass between
  Glenosheen and Glenanaar, Co. Limerick, for which see Dr. R.&nbsp;D. Joyce's
  'Ballads of Irish Chivalry,' pp. 102, 103, 120.</p>

  <p>Old Tom Howlett, a Dublin job gardener, speaking to me of the
  management of fruit trees, recommended the use of butchers' waste. 'Ah
  sir'&mdash;said he, with a luscious roll in his voice as if he had been
  licking his lips&mdash;'Ah sir, there's nothing for the roots of an apple
  tree like a big tub of fine rotten <i>ould</i> guts,' <!-- Page 100
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"></a>{100}</span></p>

  <p>Final <i>d</i> is often omitted after <i>l</i> and <i>n</i>: you will
  see this everywhere in Seumas MacManus's books for Donegal. Recently we
  were told by the attendant boy at one of the Dublin seaside baths that
  the prices were&mdash;'a shilling for the hot and sixpence for the
  <i>cowl</i>.' So we constantly use <i>an'</i> for <i>and</i>: in a
  Waterford folk song we have 'Here's to the swan that sails on the
  <i>pon</i>' (the 'swan' being the poet's sweetheart): and I once heard a
  man say to another in a fair:&mdash;'That horse is sound in win' and
  limb.'</p>

  <p>Short <i>e</i> is always sounded before <i>n</i> and <i>m</i>, and
  sometimes in other positions, like short <i>i</i>: 'How many arrived?'
  '<i>Tin min</i> and five women': 'He always smoked a pipe with a long
  <i>stim</i>.' If you ask a person for a pin, he will inquire 'Is it a
  brass pin or a writing <i>pin</i> you want?'</p>

  <p><i>Again</i> is sounded by the Irish people <i>agin</i>, which is an
  old English survival. 'Donne rhymes <i>again</i> with <i>sin</i>, and
  Quarles repeatedly with <i>in</i>.' (Lowell.) An Irishman was once landed
  on the coast of some unknown country where they spoke English. Some
  violent political dispute happened to be going on there at the time, and
  the people eagerly asked the stranger about his political views; on
  which&mdash;instinctively giving expression to the feelings he brought
  with him from the 'ould sod'&mdash;he promptly replied before making any
  inquiry&mdash;'I'm agin the Government.' This story, which is pretty well
  known, is a faked one; but it affords us a good illustration.</p>

  <p><i>Onion</i> is among our people always pronounced <i>ingion</i>:
  constantly heard in Dublin. 'Go out Mike <!-- Page 101 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page101"></a>{101}</span>for the
  <i>ingions</i>,' as I once heard a woman say in Limerick.</p>

  from the end of the word as possible. But among our people there is a
  contrary tendency&mdash;to throw forward the accent; as in

  <p>In Gough's Arithmetic there was a short section on the laws of
  radiation and of pendulums. When I was a boy I once heard one of the old
  schoolmasters reading out, in his grandiloquent way, for the people
  grouped round Ardpatrick chapel gate after Mass, his formidable
  prospectus of the subjects he could teach, among which were 'the
  <i>raddiation</i> of light and heat and the vibrations of swinging
  <i>pen-joo´lums</i>.' The same fine old scholarly pedant once remarked
  that our neighbourhood was a very <i>moun-taan´-yus</i> locality. A
  little later on in my life, when I had written some pieces in high-flown
  English&mdash;as young writers will often do&mdash;one of these
  schoolmasters&mdash;a much lower class of man than the last&mdash;said to
  me by way of compliment: 'Ah! Mr. Joyce, you have a fine

  <p><i>Mischievous</i> is in the south accented on the second

  <p>and this word 'contrairy' is universal in Munster.</p>

  <p>In Tipperary the vowel <i>i</i> is generally sounded <i>oi</i>. Mick
  Hogan a Tipperary boy&mdash;he was a man indeed&mdash;was a pupil in Mr.
  Condon's school in Mitchelstown, with the full rich typical accent. One
  morning as he walked in, a fellow pupil, Tom Burke&mdash;a big fellow
  too&mdash;with face down on desk over a book, said, without lifting his
  head&mdash;to make fun of him&mdash;'<i>foine</i> day, Mick.' 'Yes,' said
  Mick as he walked past, at the same time laying his hand on Tom's poll
  and punching his nose down hard against the desk. Tom let Mick alone
  after that 'foine day.' Farther south, and in many places all over
  Ireland, they do the reverse:&mdash;'The kettle is <i>biling</i>';</p>

  <p>Among the old-fashioned and better-educated of our peasantry you will
  still hear this old pronunciation preserved:&mdash;I am very much
  obleeged to you. It is now generally heard in Kildare among all classes.
  A similar tendency is in the sound of <i>whine</i>, which in Munster is
  always made <i>wheen</i>: 'What's that poor child <i>wheening</i> for?'
  also everywhere heard:&mdash;'All danger [of the fever] is now past: he
  is over his <i>creesis</i>.'</p>

  <p>Metathesis, or the changing of the place of a letter or syllable in a
  word, is very common among the Irish people, as <i>cruds</i> for
  <i>curds</i>, <i>girn</i> for <i>grin</i>, <i>purty</i> for
  <i>pretty</i>. I heard a man quoting from Shakespeare about
  Puck&mdash;from hearsay: he said he must have been a wonderful fellow,
  for he could put a <i>griddle</i> round about the earth in forty
  minutes.' I knew a fellow that could never say <i>traveller</i>: it was
  always <i>throlliver</i>.</p>

  <p>There is a tendency here as elsewhere to shorten many words: You will
  hear <i>garner</i> for <i>gardener</i>, <i>ornary</i> for
  <i>ordinary</i>. The late Cardinal Cullen was always spoken of by a
  friend of mine who revered him, as <i>The Carnal</i>.</p>

  <p><i>My</i> and <i>by</i> are pronounced <i>me</i> and <i>be</i> all
  over Ireland: Now <i>me</i> boy I expect you home <i>be</i> six
  o'clock.</p>

  <p>The obscure sound of <i>e</i> and <i>i</i> heard in <i>her</i> and
  <i>fir</i> is hardly known in Ireland, at least among the general run of
  people. <i>Her</i> is made either <i>herr</i> or <i>hur</i>. They sound
  <i>sir</i> either <i>surr</i> (to rhyme with cur), <!-- Page 104 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page104"></a>{104}</span>or <i>serr</i>; but in
  this latter case they always give the <i>r</i> or <i>rr</i> what is
  called the slender sound in Irish, which there is no means of indicating
  by English letters. <i>Fir</i> is also sounded either <i>fur</i> or
  <i>ferr</i> (a <i>fur</i> tree or a <i>ferr</i> tree). <i>Furze</i> is
  pronounced rightly; but they take it to be a plural, and so you will
  often hear the people say <i>a fur bush</i> instead of <i>a furze
  bush</i>.</p>

  <p>In other classes of words <i>i</i> before <i>r</i> is mispronounced. A
  young fellow, Johnny Brien, objected to go by night on a message that
  would oblige him to pass by an empty old house that had the reputation of
  being haunted, because, as he said, he was afeard of the
  <i>sperrit</i>.</p>

  <p>In like manner, <i>miracle</i> is pronounced <i>merricle</i>. Jack
  Finn&mdash;a little busybody noted for perpetually jibing at sacred
  things&mdash;Jack one day, with innocence in his face, says to Father
  Tom, 'Wisha I'd be terrible thankful entirely to your reverence to tell
  me what a merricle is, for I could never understand it.' 'Oh yes Jack,'
  says the big priest good-naturedly, as he stood ready equipped for a long
  ride to a sick call&mdash;poor old Widow Dwan up in the mountain gap:
  'Just tell me exactly how many cows are grazing in that field there
  behind you.' Jack, chuckling at the fun that was coming on, turned round
  to count, on which Father Tom dealt him a hearty kick that sent him
  sprawling about three yards. He gathered himself up as best he could; but
  before he had time to open his mouth the priest asked, 'Did you feel that
  Jack?' 'Oh Blood-an ... Yerra of course I did your reverence, why the
  blazes wouldn't I!' 'Well Jack,' replied Father Tom, benignly, 'If you
  didn't feel it&mdash;<i>that</i> would be a <i>merricle</i>.' <!-- Page

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">PROVERBS.</p>

  <p>The Irish delighted in sententious maxims and apt illustrations
  compressed into the fewest possible words. Many of their proverbs were
  evolved in the Irish language, of which a collection with translations by
  John O'Donovan may be seen in the 'Dublin Penny Journal,' I. 258; another
  in the Rev. Ulick Bourke's Irish Grammar; and still another in the Ulster
  Journ. of Archæology (old series) by Mr. Robert MacAdam, the Editor. The
  same tendency continued when the people adopted the English language.
  Those that I give here in collected form were taken from the living lips
  of the people during the last thirty or forty years.</p>

  <p>'Be first in a wood and last in a bog.' If two persons are making
  their way, one behind the other, through a wood, the hinder man gets
  slashed in the face by the springy boughs pushed aside by the first: if
  through a bog, the man behind can always avoid the dangerous holes by
  seeing the first sink into them. This proverb preserves the memory of a
  time when there were more woods and bogs than there are now: it is
  translated from Irish.</p>

  <p>In some cases a small amount added on or taken off makes a great
  difference in the result: 'An inch is a great deal in a man's nose.' In
  the Crimean war an officer happened to be walking past an Irish soldier
  on duty, who raised hand to cap to salute. <!-- Page 106 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>{106}</span>But the hand was only
  half way when a stray bullet whizzed by and knocked off the cap without
  doing any injury. Whereupon Paddy, perfectly unmoved, stooped down,
  replaced the cap and completed the salute. The officer, admiring his
  coolness, said 'That was a narrow shave my man!' 'Yes your honour: an
  inch is as good as a mile.' This is one of our commonest sayings.</p>

  <p>A person is reproved for some trifling harmless liberty, and
  replies:&mdash;'Oh a cat can look at a king.' (A translation from
  Irish.)</p>

  <p>A person who fails to get what he was striving after is often glad to
  accept something very inferior: 'When all fruit fails welcome haws.'</p>

  <p>When a person shows no sign of gratitude for a good turn as if it
  passed completely from his memory, people say 'Eaten bread is soon
  forgotten.'</p>

  <p>A person is sent upon some dangerous mission, as when the persons he
  is going to are his deadly enemies:&mdash;that is 'Sending the goose on a
  message to the fox's den.'</p>

  <p>If a dishonest avaricious man is put in a position of authority over
  people from whom he has the power to extort money; that is 'putting the
  fox to mind the geese.'</p>

  <p>'You have as many kinds of potatoes on the table as if you took them
  from a beggarman's bag': referring to the good old time when beggarmen
  went about and usually got a <i>lyre</i> of potatoes in each house.</p>

  <p>'No one can tell what he is able to do till he tries,' as the duck
  said when she swallowed a dead kitten. <!-- Page 107 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>{107}</span></p>

  <p>You say to a man who is suffering under some continued
  hardship:&mdash;'This distress is only temporary: have patience and
  things will come round soon again.' 'O yes indeed; <i>Live horse till you
  get grass</i>.'</p>

  <p>A person in your employment is not giving satisfaction; and yet you
  are loth to part with him for another: 'Better is the devil you know than
  the devil you don't know.'</p>

  <p>'Least said, soonest mended.'</p>

  <p>'You spoke too late,' as the fool said when he swallowed a bad egg,
  and heard the chicken chirp going down his throat.</p>

  <p>'Good soles bad uppers.' Applied to a person raised from a low to a
  high station, who did well enough while low, but in his present position
  is overbearing and offensive.</p>

  <p>I have done a person some service: and now he ill-naturedly refuses
  some reasonable request. I say: 'Oh wait: <i>apples will grow again</i>.'
  He answers&mdash;'Yes <i>if the trees baint cut</i>'&mdash;a defiant and
  ungrateful answer, as much as to say&mdash;you may not have the
  opportunity to serve me, or I may not want it.</p>

  <p>Turf or peat was scarce in Kilmallock (Co. Limerick): whence the
  proverb, 'A Kilmallock fire&mdash;two sods and a <i>kyraun</i>' (a bit
  broken <i>off of</i> a sod).</p>

  <p>People are often punished even in this world for their misdeeds: 'God
  Almighty often pays debts without money.' (Wicklow.)</p>

  <p>I advise you not to do so without the master's
  permission:&mdash;'Leave is light.' A very general saying. <!-- Page 108
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>{108}</span></p>

  <p>When a person gives much civil talk, makes plausible excuses or fair
  promises, the remark is made 'Soft words butter no parsnips.' Sometimes
  also 'Talk is cheap.'</p>

  <p>A person who is too complaisant&mdash;over anxious to please
  everyone&mdash;is 'like Lanna Mochree's dog&mdash;he will go a part of
  the road with everyone.' (Moran Carlow.) (A witness said this of a
  policeman in the Celbridge courthouse&mdash;Kildare&mdash;last year,
  showing that it is still alive.)</p>

  <p>'The first drop of the broth is the hottest': the first step in any
  enterprise is usually the hardest. (Westmeath.)</p>

  <p>The light, consisting of a single candle, or the jug of punch from
  which the company fill their tumblers, ought always to be placed on the
  middle of the table when people are sitting round it:&mdash;'Put the
  priest in the middle of the parish.'</p>

  <p>'After a gathering comes a scattering.' 'A narrow gathering, a broad
  scattering.' Both allude to the case of a thrifty man who gathers up a
  fortune during a lifetime, and is succeeded by a spendthrift son who soon
  <i>makes ducks and drakes</i> of the property.</p>

  <p>No matter how old a man is he can get a wife if he wants one: 'There
  never was an old slipper but there was an old stocking to match it.'
  (Carlow.)</p>

  <p>'You might as well go to hell with a load as with a <i>pahil</i>':
  'You might as well hang for a sheep as for a lamb': both explain
  themselves. A <i>pahil</i> or <i>paghil</i> is a bundle of anything.
  (Derry.)</p>

  <p>If a man treats you badly in any way, you threaten to pay him back in
  his own coin by saying, 'The cat hasn't eaten the year yet.' (Carlow.)
  <!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page109"></a>{109}</span></p>

  <p>'A fool and his money are easily parted.'</p>

  <p>'A dumb priest never got a parish,' as much as to say if a man wants a
  thing he must ask and strive for it.</p>

  <p>'A slip of the tongue is no fault of the mind.' (Munster.)</p>

  <p>You merely hint at something requiring no further
  explanation:&mdash;'A nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse.' (Sam
  Lover: but heard everywhere.)</p>

  <p>A very wise proverb often heard among us is:&mdash;'Let well enough
  alone.'</p>

  <p>'When a man is down, down with him': a bitter allusion to the tendency
  of the world to trample down the unfortunate and helpless.</p>

  <p>'The friend that can be bought is not worth buying.' (Moran:
  Carlow.)</p>

  <p>'The life of an old hat is to cock it.' To cock an old hat is to set
  it jauntingly on the head with the leaf turned up at one side. (S. E.
  counties.)</p>

  <p>'The man that wears the shoe knows where it pinches.' It is only the
  person holding any position that knows the troubles connected with
  it.</p>

  <p>'Enough and no waste is as good as a <i>faist</i>.'</p>

  <p>'There are more ways of killing a dog than by choking him with
  butter.' Applied when some insidious cunning attempt that looks innocent
  is made to injure another.</p>

  <p>'Well James are you quite recovered now?' 'Oh yes, I'm <i>on the
  baker's list</i> again': i.e., I am well and have recovered my
  appetite.</p>

  <p>'An Irishman before answering a question always asks another': he
  wants to know why he is asked.</p>

  <p>Dan O'Loghlin, a working man, drove up to our <!-- Page 110 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page110"></a>{110}</span>house one day on an
  outside car. It was a sixpenny drive, but rather a long one; and the
  carman began to grumble. Whereupon Dan, in the utmost good humour,
  replied:&mdash;'Oh you must take the little potato with the big potato.'
  A very apt maxim in many of life's affairs, and often heard in and around
  Dublin.</p>

  <p>'Good goods are tied up in small parcels': said of a little man or a
  little woman, in praise or mitigation. (Moran: Carlow.)</p>

  <p>'Easy with the hay, there are boys on the ladder.' When a man is on
  the top of the stack forking down hay, he is warned to look out and be
  careful if other <i>boys</i> are mounting up the ladder, lest he may
  pitch it on their heads. The proverb is uttered when a person is
  incautiously giving expression to words likely to offend some one
  present. (Moran: Carlow.)</p>

  <p>Be cautious about believing the words of a man speaking ill of another
  against whom he has a grudge: 'Spite never spoke well.' (Moran:
  Carlow.)</p>

  <p>Don't encroach too much on a privilege or it may be withdrawn: don't
  ask too much or you may get nothing at all:&mdash;'Covetousness bursts
  the bag.'</p>

  <p>Three things not to be trusted&mdash;a cow's horn, a dog's tooth, and
  a horse's hoof.</p>

  <p>Three disagreeable things at home:&mdash;a scolding wife; a squalling
  child; and a smoky chimney.</p>

  <p>Three good things to have. I heard this given as a toast exactly as I
  give it here, by a fine old gentleman of the old times:&mdash;'Here's
  that we may always have a <i>clane</i> shirt; a <i>clane</i> conscience;
  and a guinea in our pocket.' <!-- Page 111 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page111"></a>{111}</span></p>

  <p>Here is another toast. A happy little family party round the farmer's
  fire with a big jug on the table (a jug of what, do you think?) The old
  blind piper is the happiest of all, and holding up his glass
  says:&mdash;'Here's, if this be war may we never have peace.' (Edw.
  Walsh.)</p>

  <p>Three things no person ever saw:&mdash;a highlander's kneebuckle, a
  dead ass, a tinker's funeral.</p>

  <p>'Take care to lay by for the sore foot': i.e., Provide against
  accidents, against adversity or want; against the rainy day.</p>

  <p>When you impute another person's actions to evil or unworthy motives:
  that is 'measuring other people's corn in your own bushel.'</p>

  <p>A person has taken some unwise step: another expresses his intention
  to do a similar thing, and you say:&mdash;'One fool is enough in a
  parish.'</p>

  <p>In the middle of last century, the people of Carlow and its
  neighbourhood prided themselves on being able to give, on the spur of the
  moment, toasts suitable to the occasion. Here is one such: 'Here's to the
  herring that never took a bait'; a toast reflecting on some person
  present who had been made a fool of in some transaction. (Moran:
  Carlow.)</p>

  <p>'A man cannot grow rich without his wife's leave': as much as to say,
  a farmer's wife must co-operate to ensure success and prosperity. (Moran:
  Carlow.)</p>

  <p>When something is said that has a meaning under the surface the remark
  is made 'There's gravel in that.'</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Pity people barefoot in cold frosty weather,</p>
      <p>But don't make them boots with other people's leather.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>{112}</span></p>

  <p>That is to say: don't be generous at other people's expense. Many
  years ago this proverb was quoted by the late Serjeant Armstrong in
  addressing a jury in Wicklow.</p>

  <p>'A wet night: a dry morning': said to a man who is
  <i>craw-sick</i>&mdash;thirsty and sick&mdash;after a night's boozing.
  (Moran: Carlow.)</p>

  <p>This last reminds me of an invitation I once got from a country
  gentleman to go on a visit, holding out as an inducement that he would
  give me 'a dry bed and a wet bottle.'</p>

  <p>'If he's not fishing he's mending his nets': said of a man who always
  makes careful preparations and lays down plans for any enterprise he may
  have in view.</p>

  <p>'If he had a shilling in his pocket it would burn a hole through it':
  said of a man who cannot keep his money together&mdash;a spendthrift.</p>

  <p>'A bird with one wing can't fly': said to a person to make him take a
  second glass. (Moran: Carlow.)</p>

  <p>Protect your rights: 'Don't let your bone go with the dog.'</p>

  <p>'An old dog for a hard road': said in commendation of a wary person
  who has overcome some difficulty. <i>Hard</i> in this proverb means
  'difficult.' (Moran: Carlow.)</p>

  <p>'No use sending a boy on a man's errand': Don't be satisfied with
  inadequate steps when undertaking a difficult work: employ a sure person
  to carry out a hard task.</p>

  <p>Oh however he may have acted towards you he has been a good friend to
  me at any rate; and I go by the old saying, 'Praise the ford as you find
  it.' This <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page113"></a>{113}</span>proverb is a translation from the Irish.
  It refers to a time when bridges were less general than now; and rivers
  were commonly crossed by fords&mdash;which were sometimes safe, sometimes
  dangerous, according to the weather.</p>

  <p>'Threatened dogs live long.' Abuses often go on for a long time,
  though people are constantly complaining and threatening to correct them.
  (Ulster.)</p>

  <p>He who expects a legacy when another man dies thinks the time long.
  'It is long waiting for a dead man's boots.' (Moran: Carlow.)</p>

  <p>A person waiting impatiently for something to come on always thinks
  the time longer than usual:&mdash;'A watched pot never boils.'</p>

  <p>'A poor man must have a poor wedding': people must live according to
  their means.</p>

  <p>'I could carry my wet finger to him': i.e. he is here present, but I
  won't name him.</p>

  <p>'Oh that's all <i>as I roved out</i>': to express unbelief in what
  someone says as quite unworthy of credit. In allusion to songs beginning
  'As I roved out,' which are generally fictitious.</p>

  <p>'Your father was a bad glazier': said to a person who is standing in
  one's light.</p>

  <p>'As the old cock crows the young cock learns': generally applied to a
  son who follows the evil example of his father.</p>

  <p>A person remarks that the precautions you are taking in regard to a
  certain matter are unnecessary or excessive, and you reply 'Better be
  sure than sorry.'</p>

  <p>'She has a good many nicks in her horn': said of a girl who is
  becoming an old maid. A cow is said to have a nick in her horn for every
  year. <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page114"></a>{114}</span></p>

  <p>A man of property gets into hopeless debt and difficulty by neglecting
  his business, and his creditors sell him out. 'Well, how did he get out
  of it?' asks a neighbour. 'Oh, he got out of it just by a break-up, <i>as
  Katty got out of the pot</i>.' This is how Katty got out of the pot. One
  day at dinner in the kitchen Katty Murphy the servant girl sat down on a
  big pot (as I often saw women do)&mdash;for seats were scarce; and in the
  middle of the dinner, through some incautious movement, down she went.
  She struggled to get up, but failed. Then the others came to help her,
  and tugged and pulled and tried in every way, but had to give it up; till
  at last one of them brought a heavy hammer, and with one blow made
  smithereens of the pot.</p>

  <p>'Putting a thing on the long finger' means postponing it.</p>

  <p>On the evil of procrastination:&mdash;'<i>Time enough</i> lost the
  ducks.' The ducks should have been secured at once as it was known that a
  fox was prowling about. But they were not, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>'<i>Will you</i> was never a good fellow.' The bad fellow says 'Will
  you have some lunch?' (while there is as yet nothing on the table), on
  the chance that the visitor will say 'No, thank you.' The good hospitable
  man asks no questions, but has the food brought up and placed before the
  guest.</p>

  <p>'Cut the <i>gad</i> next the throat': that is to say, attend to the
  most urgent need first. You find a man hanging by a <i>gad</i> (withe),
  and you cut him down to save him. Cutting the <i>gad</i> next the throat
  explains itself.</p>

  <p>When a work must be done slowly:&mdash;'I will do <!-- Page 115
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page115"></a>{115}</span>it by degrees
  as lawyers go to heaven.' (Moran: Carlow.)</p>

  <p>'That's not a good fit,' as the serpent said when he swallowed a buck
  goat, horns and all.</p>

  <p>Time and patience would bring a snail to America.</p>

  <p>'The cold stone leaves the water on St. Patrick's Day.' About the 17th
  March (St. Patrick's Day), the winter's cold is nearly gone, and the
  weather generally takes a milder turn.</p>

  <p>'There are more turners than dishmakers'; meaning, there may be many
  members of a profession, but only few of them excel in it: usually
  pointed at some particular professional man, who is considered not
  clever. It is only the most skilful turners that can make wooden
  dishes.</p>

  <p>A person who talks too much cannot escape saying things now and then
  that would be better left unsaid:&mdash;'The mill that is always going
  grinds coarse and fine.'</p>

  <p>'If you lie down with dogs you will get up with fleas': if you keep
  company with bad people you will contract their evil habits. (Moran:
  Carlow.)</p>

  <p>If you do a kindness don't mar it by any unpleasant drawback: in other
  words do a kind act graciously:&mdash;'If you give away an old coat don't
  cut off the buttons.'</p>

  <p>Two good things:&mdash;A young man courting, an old man smoking: Two
  bad things:&mdash;An old man courting, a young man smoking. (MacCall:
  Wexford.)</p>

  <p>What is the world to a man when his wife is a widow.</p>

  <p>Giving help where it is needed is 'helping the lame dog over the
  stile.' <!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page116"></a>{116}</span></p>

  <p>'Leave him to God': meaning don't you attempt to punish him for the
  injury he has done you: let God deal with him. Often carried too far
  among us.</p>

  <p>A hard man at driving a bargain:&mdash;'He always wants an egg in the
  penn'orth.' (Kildare.)</p>

  <p>A satirical expression regarding a close-fisted ungenerous
  man:&mdash;'If he had only an egg he'd give you the shell.'
  (Kildare.)</p>

  <p>A man wishes to say to another that they are both of about the same
  age; and this is how he expresses it:&mdash;'When I die of old age you
  may quake with fear.' (Kildare.)</p>

  <p>Speaking of a man with more resources than one:&mdash;'It wasn't on
  one leg St. Patrick came to Ireland.'</p>

  <p>When there is a prospect of a good harvest, or any mark of
  prosperity:&mdash;'That's no sign of small potatoes.' (Kildare.)</p>

  <p>Your friend is in your pocket. (Kildare.)</p>

  <p>[As a safe general principle]:&mdash;'If anybody asks you, say you
  don't know.'</p>

  <p>'A good run is better than a bad stand.' When it becomes obvious that
  you cannot defend your position (whatever it is), better yield than
  encounter certain defeat by continuing to resist. (Queenstown.)</p>

  <p>A man depending for success on a very uncertain
  contingency:&mdash;'God give you better meat than a running hare.'
  (Tyrone.)</p>

  <p>To express the impossibility of doing two inconsistent things at the
  same time:&mdash;'You can't whistle and chaw meal.' <!-- Page 117
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>{117}</span></p>

  <p>A man who has an excess of smooth plausible talk is 'too sweet to be
  wholesome.'</p>

  <p>'The fox has a good name in his own parish.' They say that a fox does
  not prey on the fowls in his own neighbourhood. Often said of a rogue
  whose friends are trying to <i>whitewash</i> him.</p>

  <p>'A black hen lays white eggs.' A man with rough manners often has a
  gentle heart and does kindly actions.</p>

  <p>Much in the same sense:&mdash;'A crabtree has a sweet blossom.'</p>

  <p>A person who has smooth words and kind professions for others, but
  never acts up to them, 'has a hand for everybody but a heart for nobody.'
  (Munster.)</p>

  <p>A person readily finds a lost article when it is missed, and is
  suspected to have hidden it himself:&mdash;'What the Pooka writes he can
  read.' (Munster.)</p>

  <p>A man is making no improvement in his character or circumstances but
  rather the reverse as he advances in life:&mdash;'A year older and a year
  worse.'</p>

  <p>'A shut mouth catches no flies.' Much the same as the English 'Speech
  is silvern, silence is golden.'</p>

  <p>To the same effect is 'Hear and see and say nothing.'</p>

  <p>A fool and his money are easily parted.</p>

  <p>Oh I see you expect that Jack (a false friend) will stand at your
  back. Yes, indeed, 'he'll stand at your back while your nose is
  breaking.'</p>

  <p>'You wouldn't do that to your match' as Mick Sheedy said to the fox.
  Mick Sheedy the gamekeeper had a hut in the woods where he often took
  <!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page118"></a>{118}</span>shelter and rested and smoked. One day
  when he had arrived at the doorway he saw a fox sitting at the little
  fire warming himself. Mick instantly spread himself out in the doorway to
  prevent escape. And so they continued to look at each other. At last
  Reynard, perceiving that some master-stroke was necessary, took up in his
  mouth one of a fine pair of shoes that were lying in a corner, brought it
  over, and deliberately placed it on the top of the fire. We know the

  <p>When a fellow puts on empty airs of great consequence, you say to him,
  'Why you're <i>as grand as Mat Flanagan with the cat</i>': always said
  contemptuously. Mat Flanagan went to London one time. After two years he
  came home on a visit; but he was <!-- Page 119 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page119"></a>{119}</span>now transformed into
  such a mass of grandeur that he did not recognise any of the old
  surroundings. He didn't know what the old cat was. 'Hallo, mother,' said
  he with a lofty air and a killing Cockney accent, 'What's yon long-tailed
  fellow in yon <i>cawner</i>?'</p>

  <p>I express myself confident of outwitting or circumventing a certain
  man who is notoriously cautious and wide-awake, and the listener says to
  me:&mdash;'Oh, what a chance you have&mdash;<i>catch a weasel asleep</i>'
  (general).</p>

  <p>In connexion with this may be given another proverb: of a notoriously
  wide-awake cautious man, it is said:&mdash;'He sleeps a hare's
  sleep&mdash;with one eye open.' For it was said one time that weasels
  were in the habit of sucking the blood of hares in their sleep; and as
  weasels had much increased, the hares took to the plan of sleeping with
  one eye at a time; 'and when that's rested and <i>slep</i> enough, they
  open it and shut the other.' (From 'The Building of Mourne,' by Dr.
  Robert Dwyer Joyce.) <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>This last perpetuates a legend as old as our literature. In one of the
  ancient Irish classical tales, the story is told of a young lady so
  beautiful that all the young chiefs of the territory were in love with
  her and laying plans to take her off. So her father, to defeat them,
  slept with only one eye at a time.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">EXAGGERATION AND REDUNDANCY.</p>

  <p>I have included both in this Chapter, for they are nearly related; and
  it is often hard to draw a precise line of distinction.</p>

  <p>We in Ireland are rather prone to exaggeration, perhaps more so than
  the average run of peoples. Very often the expressions are jocose, or the
  person is fully conscious of the exaggeration; but in numerous cases
  there is no joke at all: but downright seriousness: all which will be
  seen in the following examples.</p>

  <p>A common saying about a person of persuasive tongue or with a
  beautiful voice in singing:&mdash;'He would coax the birds off the
  bushes.' This is borrowed from the Irish. In the 'Lament of Richard
  Cantillon' (in Irish) he says that at the musical voice of the lady 'the
  seals would come up from the deep, the stag down from the mist-crag, and
  the thrush from the tree.' (Petrie: 'Anc. Mus. of Ireland.')</p>

  <p>Of a noted liar and perjurer it was said 'He would swear that a coal
  porter was a canary.' <!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page121"></a>{121}</span></p>

  <p>A man who is unlucky, with whom everything goes wrong:&mdash;'If that
  man got a hen to hatch duck eggs, the young ducks would be drowned.' Or
  again, 'If that man sowed oats in a field, a crop of turnips would come
  up.' Or: 'He is always in the field when luck is on the road.'</p>

  <p>The following expression is often heard:&mdash;'Ah, old James Buckley
  is a fine piper: <i>I'd give my eyes</i> to be listening to him.'</p>

  <p>That fellow is so dirty that if you flung him against a wall he'd
  stick. (Patterson: Ulster.)</p>

  <p>Two young men are about to set off to seek their fortunes, leaving
  their young brother Rory to stay with their mother. But Rory, a hard
  active merry cute little fellow, proposes to go with them:&mdash;'I'll
  follow ye to the world's end.' On which the eldest says to him&mdash;a
  half playful threat:&mdash;'You presumptious little atomy of a barebones,
  if I only see the size of a thrush's ankle of you follyin' us on the
  road, I'll turn back and bate that wiry and freckled little carcase of
  yours into frog's-jelly!' (Robert Dwyer Joyce: 'The Building of
  Mourne.')</p>

  <p>'Did Johnny give you any of his sugar-stick?' 'Oh not very much
  indeed: hardly the size of a thrush's ankle.' This term is often
  used.</p>

  <p>Of a very morose sour person you will hear it said:&mdash;'If that man
  looked at a pail of new milk he'd turn it into curds and whey.'</p>

  <p>A very thin man, or one attenuated by sickness:&mdash;'You could blow
  him off your hand.'</p>

  <p>A poor fellow complains of the little bit of meat he got for his
  dinner:&mdash;'It was no more than a daisy in a bull's mouth!' Another
  says of <i>his</i> dinner <!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page122"></a>{122}</span>when it was in his stomach:&mdash;'It was
  no more than a midge in the Glen of the Downs.'</p>

  <p>Exhorting a messenger to be quick:&mdash;'Don't be there till you're
  back again.' Another way:&mdash;'Now run as quick as you can, and if you
  fall don't wait to get up.' Warning a person to be expeditious in any
  work you put him to:&mdash;'Now don't let grass grow under your feet.'
  Barney urging on the ass to go quickly:&mdash;'Come Bobby, don't let
  grass grow under your feet.' ('Knocknagow.')</p>

  <p>If a person is secretly very willing to go to a place&mdash;as a lover
  to the house of the girl's parents:&mdash;'You could lead him there with
  a halter of snow.'</p>

  <p>'Is this razor sharp?' 'Sharp!&mdash;why <i>'twould shave a mouse
  asleep</i>.'</p>

  <p>A lazy fellow, fond of sitting at the fire, <i>has the A B C on his
  shins</i>, i.e. they are blotched with the heat.</p>

  <p>Of an inveterate talker:&mdash;That man would talk the teeth out of a
  saw.</p>

  <p>A young fellow gets a great fright:&mdash;'It frightened him out of a
  year's growth.'</p>

  <p>When Nancy saw the master so angry she was frightened out of her wits:
  or frightened out of her seven senses. When I saw the horse ride over him
  I was frightened out of my life.</p>

  <p>A great liar, being suddenly pressed for an answer, told the truth for
  once. He told the truth because he was <i>shook</i> for a lie; i.e. no
  lie was ready at hand. <i>Shook</i>, to be bad, in a bad way: shook for a
  thing, to be badly in want of it and not able to get it.</p>

  <p>Of a very lazy fellow:&mdash;He would not knock a coal off his foot:
  i.e. when a live coal happens to <!-- Page 123 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page123"></a>{123}</span>fall on his foot while
  sitting by the fire, he wouldn't take the trouble to knock it off.</p>

  <p>Says the dragon to Manus:&mdash;'If ever I see you here again I'll
  hang a quarter of you on every tree in the wood.' (Crofton Croker.)</p>

  <p>If a person is pretty badly hurt, or suffers hardship, he's
  <i>kilt</i> (killed): a fellow gets a fall and his friend comes up to
  inquire:&mdash;'Oh let me alone I'm kilt and speechless.' I heard a
  Dublin nurse say, 'Oh I'm kilt minding these four children.' 'The bloody
  throopers are coming to kill and quarther an' murther every mother's sowl
  o' ye.' (R. D. Joyce.) The parlour bell rings impatiently for the third
  time, and Lowry Looby the servant says, 'Oh murther there goes the bell
  again, I'll be kilt entirely.' (Gerald Griffin.) If a person is really
  badly hurt he's <i>murthered entirely</i>. A girl telling about a fight
  in a fair:&mdash;'One poor boy was kilt dead for three hours on a car,
  breathing for all the world like a corpse!'</p>

  <p>If you don't stop your abuse I'll give you a shirt full of sore
  bones.</p>

  <p>Yes, poor Jack was once well off, but now he hasn't as much money as
  would jingle on a tombstone.</p>

  <p>That cloth is very coarse: why you could shoot straws through it.</p>

  <p>Strong dislike:&mdash;I don't like a bone in his body.</p>

  <p>'Do you know Bill Finnerty well?' 'Oh indeed I know every bone in his
  body,' i.e. I know him and all his ways intimately.</p>

  <p>A man is low stout and very fat: if you met him in the street you'd
  rather jump over him than walk round him. <!-- Page 124 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>{124}</span></p>

  <p>He knew as much Latin as if he swallowed a dictionary. (Gerald
  Griffin.)</p>

  <p>The word <i>destroy</i> is very often used to characterize any
  trifling damage easily remedied:&mdash;That car splashed me, and my coat
  is all destroyed.</p>

  <p>'They kept me dancin' for 'em in the kitchen,' says Barney Broderick,
  'till I hadn't a leg to put under me.' ('Knocknagow.')</p>

  <p>This farm of mine is as bad land as ever a crow flew over.</p>

  <p>He's as great a rogue as ever stood in shoe-leather.</p>

  <p>When Jack heard the news of the money that was coming to him he was
  <i>jumping out of his skin</i> with delight.</p>

  <p>I bought these books at an auction, and I got them for a song: in fact
  I got them for half nothing.</p>

  <p>Very bad slow music is described as <i>the tune the old cow died
  of</i>.</p>

  <p>A child is afraid of a dog: '<i>Yerra</i> he won't touch you': meaning
  'he won't bite you.'</p>

  <p>A man having a very bad aim in shooting:&mdash;'He wouldn't hit a hole
  in a ladder.'</p>

  <p>Carleton's blind fiddler says to a young girl: 'You could dance <i>the
  Colleen dhas dhown</i> [a jig] upon a spider's cobweb without breaking
  it.'</p>

  <p>An ill-conducted man:&mdash;'That fellow would shame a field of
  tinkers.' The tinkers of sixty years ago, who were not remarkable for
  their honesty or good conduct, commonly travelled the country in
  companies, and camped out in fields or wild places.</p>

  <p>I was dying to hear the news; i.e. excessively anxious. <!-- Page 125

  <p>Where an Englishman will say 'I shall be pleased to accept your
  invitation,' an Irishman will say 'I will be delighted to accept,'
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Mick Fraher is always eating garlick and his breath has a terrible
  smell&mdash;a smell of garlick strong enough to hang your hat on.</p>

  <p>A mean thief:&mdash;He'd steal a halfpenny out of a blind beggarman's
  hat. (P. Reilly: Kild.)</p>

  <p>A dexterous thief:&mdash;He'd steal the sugar out of your punch.</p>

  <p>An inveterate horse thief:&mdash;Throw a halter in his grave and he'll
  start up and steal a horse.</p>

  <p>Of an impious and dexterous thief:&mdash;'He'd steal the cross off an
  ass's back,' combining skill and profanation. According to the religious
  legend the back of the ass is marked with a cross ever since the day of
  our Lord's public entry into Jerusalem upon an ass.</p>

  <p>A man who makes unreasonably long visits&mdash;who outstays his
  welcome:&mdash;'If that man went to a wedding he'd wait for the
  christening.'</p>

  <p>I once asked a young Dublin lady friend was she angry at not getting
  an invitation to the party: 'Oh I was fit to be tied.' A common
  expression among us to express great indignation.</p>

  <p>A person is expressing confidence that a certain good thing will
  happen which will bring advantage to everyone, but which after all is
  very unlikely, and someone replies:&mdash;'Oh yes: when the sky falls
  we'll all catch larks.'</p>

  <p>A useless unavailing proceeding, most unlikely to be attended with any
  result, such as trying to persuade a person who is obstinately bent on
  having his <!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page126"></a>{126}</span>own way:&mdash;'You might as well be
  whistling jigs to a milestone' [expecting it to dance].</p>

  <p>'Would you know him if you saw him?' 'Would I know him!&mdash;why I'd
  know his skin in a tan-yard'&mdash;'I'd know his shadow on a
  furze-bush!'</p>

  <p>A person considered very rich:&mdash;That man is <i>rotten with
  money</i>. He doesn't know what to do with his money.</p>

  <p>You gave me a great start: you put the heart across in me: my heart
  jumped into my mouth. The people said that Miss Mary Kearney put the
  heart across in Mr. Lowe, the young Englishman visitor.
  ('Knocknagow.')</p>

  <p>I heard Mat Halahan the tailor say to a man who had just fitted on a
  new coat:&mdash;That coat fits you just as if you were melted into
  it.</p>

  <p>He is as lazy as the dog that always puts his head against the wall to
  bark. (Moran: Carlow.)</p>

  <p>In running across the field where the young people were congregated
  Nelly Donovan trips and falls: and Billy Heffernan, running up,
  says:&mdash;'Oh Nelly did you fall: come here till I take you up.'
  ('Knocknagow.')</p>

  <p>'The road flew under him,' to express the swiftness of a man galloping
  or running afoot.</p>

  <p>Bessie Morris was such a flirt that Barney Broderick said she'd coort
  a haggard of sparrows. ('Knocknagow.')</p>

  <p>But after all this is not half so great an exaggeration as what the
  cultivated English poet wrote:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i12">I found her on the floor</p>
      <p>In all the storm of grief, yet beautiful,</p>

      <p>That were the world on fire it might have drowned</p>
      <p>The wrath of Heaven and quenched the mighty ruin.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A great dandy wears his hat on three hairs of his head.</p>

  <p>He said such funny things that the company were <i>splitting their
  sides</i> laughing.</p>

  <p>Matt Donovan (in 'Knocknagow') says of his potatoes that had fine
  stalks but little produce&mdash;<i>desavers</i> as he called
  them&mdash;Every stalk of 'em would make a rafter for a house. But put
  the best man in the parish to dig 'em and a duck would swallow all he'd
  be able to turn out from morning till night.</p>

  <p>Sometimes distinct numbers come in where they hardly apply. Not long
  ago I read in an article in the 'Daily Mail' by Mr. Stead, of British
  'ships all over the seven seas.' So also here at home we read 'round the
  four seas of Ireland' (which is right enough): and 'You care for nothing
  in the world but your own four bones' (i.e. nothing but yourself). 'Come
  on then, old beer-swiller, and try yourself against the four bones of an
  Irishman' (R. D. Joyce: 'The House of Lisbloom.') <i>Four bones</i> in
  this sense is very common.</p>

  <p>A person meeting a friend for the first time after a long interval
  says 'Well, it's a cure for sore eyes to see you.' 'I haven't seen you
  now for a month of <!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>When a man has to use the utmost exertion to accomplish anything or to

  The allusion is to a fellow whose clothes are falling off him for want of

  out the brass pin that fastens his collar and pin waistcoat and
  trousers-band together.</p>

  with a tongs.</i>' Very common and always used in depreciation as
  here.</p>

  <p>We in Ireland are much inclined to redundancy in our speech. It is
  quite observable&mdash;especially to an outsider&mdash;that even in our
  ordinary conversation and in answering simple questions we use more words
  than we need. We hardly ever confine ourselves to the simple English
  <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i>; we always answer by a statement. 'Is it raining,
  Kitty?' 'Oh no sir, it isn't raining at all.' 'Are you going to the fair
  to-day?' 'No indeed I am not.' 'Does your father keep on the old business
  still?' 'Oh yes certainly he does: how could he get on without it?' 'Did
  last night's storm injure your house?' 'Ah you may well say it did.' A
  very distinguished Dublin scholar and writer, having no conscious
  leanings whatever towards the Irish language, mentioned to me once that
  when he went on a visit to some friends in England they always observed
  this peculiarity in his conversation, and often laughed at his roundabout
  expressions. He remarked to me&mdash;and an acute remark it
  was&mdash;that he supposed there must be some peculiarity of this kind in
  the Irish language; in which conjecture he was quite correct. For this
  peculiarity of ours&mdash;like many others&mdash;is borrowed from the
  Irish language, as anyone may see for himself by looking through an Irish
  book of question and answer, such as a Catechism. 'Is the Son God?' 'Yes
  certainly He is.' 'Will God reward the good and punish the wicked?'
  'Certainly: there is no doubt He will.' 'Did God always exist?' 'He did;
  because He has neither beginning nor end.' And questions and answers like
  these&mdash;from Donlevy's <!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page131"></a>{131}</span>Irish Catechism for instance&mdash;might
  be given to any length.</p>

  <p>But in many other ways we show our tendency to this wordy
  overflow&mdash;still deriving our mannerism from the Irish
  language&mdash;that is to say, from modern and middle Irish. For in very
  old Irish&mdash;of the tenth, eleventh, and earlier centuries for
  instance, the tendency is the very reverse. In the specimens of this very
  old language that have come down to us, the words and phrases are so
  closely packed, that it is impossible to translate them either into
  English or Latin by an equal number of words.<a name="NtA3"
  href="#Nt3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> But this old language is too far off from
  us to have any influence in our present every-day English speech; and, as
  already remarked, we derive this peculiarity from modern Irish, or from
  middle Irish through modern. Here is a specimen in translation of
  over-worded modern Irish (Battle of Gavra, p. 141), a type of what was
  very common:&mdash;'Diarmuid himself [fighting] continued in the
  enjoyment of activity, strength, and vigour, without intermission of
  action, of weapons, or of power; until at length he dealt a full stroke
  of his keen hard-tempered sword on the king's head, by which he clove the
  skull, and by a second stroke swept his head off his huge body.' Examples
  like this, from Irish texts, both modern and middle, might be multiplied
  to any extent.</p>

<p><!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>{132}</span></p>

  <p>But let us now have a look at some of our Anglo-Irish redundancies,
  mixed up as they often are with exaggeration. A man was going to dig by
  night for a treasure, which of course had a supernatural guardian, like
  all hidden treasures, and what should he see running towards him but 'a
  great big red mad bull, with fire flaming out of his eyes, mouth, and
  nose.' (Ir. Pen. Mag.) Another man sees a leprechaun walking up to
  him&mdash;'a weeny deeny dawny little atomy of an idea of a small taste
  of a gentleman.' (<i>Ibid.</i>) Of a person making noise and uproar you
  will be told that he was roaring and screeching and bawling and making a
  terrible hullabulloo all through the house.</p>

  <p>Of an emaciated poor creature&mdash;'The breath is only just in and
  out of him, and the grass doesn't know of him walking over it.'</p>

  <p>'The gentlemen are not so pleasant <i>in themselves</i>' [now as they
  used to be]. (Gerald Griffin.) Expressions like this are very often
  heard: 'I was dead in myself,' i.e., I felt dull and lifeless.</p>

  <p>[Dermot struck the giant and] 'left him dead without life.' ('Dermot
  and Grainne.') Further on we find the same expression&mdash;<i>marbh gan
  anam</i>, dead without life. This Irish expression is constantly heard in
  our English dialect: 'he fell from the roof and was <i>killed
  dead</i>.'</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Oh brave King Brian, he knew the way</p>
      <p>To keep the peace and to make the hay:</p>
      <p>For those who were bad he cut off their head;</p>
      <p>And those who were worse he killed them dead.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Similarly the words 'dead and buried' are used all through
  Munster:&mdash;Oh indeed poor Jack Lacy is <!-- Page 133 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page133"></a>{133}</span>dead and buried for the
  last two years: or 'the whole family are dead and gone these many
  years.'</p>

  <p>A very common Irish expression is 'I invited <i>every single one</i>
  of them.' This is merely a translation from Irish, as we find in
  'Gabhra':&mdash;<i>Do bhéarmaois gach aon bhuadh</i>: we were wont to win
  every single victory.</p>

  <p>'We do not want any single one of them,' says Mr. Hamilton Fyfe
  ('Daily Mail'). He puts the saying into the mouth of another; but the
  phraseology is probably his own: and at any rate I suppose we may take it
  as a phrase from Scotch Gaelic, which is all but the same as Irish
  Gaelic.</p>

  <p>Emphatic particles and words, especially the pronouns with
  <i>self</i>, are often used to excess. I heard a highly educated
  fellow-countryman say, 'I must say myself that I don't believe it': and I
  am afraid I often use such expressions myself. 'His companions remained
  standing, but he found it more convenient to sit down himself.' A writer
  or speaker has however to be on his guard or he may be led into a trap. A
  writer having stated that some young ladies attended a cookery-class,
  first merely looking on, goes on to say that after a time they took part
  in the work, and soon learned <i>to cook themselves</i>.</p>

  <p>I once heard a man say:&mdash;'I disown the whole family, <i>seed,
  breed and generation</i>.' Very common in Ireland. Goldsmith took the
  expression from his own country, and has immortalised it in his essay,
  'The Distresses of a Common Soldier.'</p>

  <p>He was on the tip-top of the steeple&mdash;i.e., the very top. This
  expression is extended in application: that <!-- Page 134 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page134"></a>{134}</span>meadow is tip-top,
  i.e., very excellent: he is a tip-top hurler. 'By no means' is sometimes
  expanded:&mdash;'I asked him to lend me a pound, but he answered that
  <i>by no manner of means</i> would he do any such thing.'</p>

  <p>'If you do that you'll be crying down salt tears,' i.e., 'you'll
  deeply regret it.' <i>Salt tears</i> is however in Shakespeare in the
  same sense. ('Hen. VI.')</p>

  <p>'Down with you now on your two bended knees and give thanks to
  God.'</p>

  <p>If you don't stop, I'll wring the head off o' your neck. (Rev. Maxwell
  Close.)</p>

  <p>The roof of the house fell down on the top of him. (Father
  Higgins.)</p>

  <p>The Irish <i>air sé</i> ('says he') is very often repeated in the
  course of a narrative. It is correct in Irish, but it is often heard
  echoed in our English where it is incorrect:&mdash;And says he to James
  'where are you going now?' says he.</p>

  <p>In a trial in Dublin a short time ago, the counsel asked of
  witness:&mdash;'Now I ask you in the most solemn manner, had you hand,
  act, or part in the death of Peter Heffernan?'</p>

  <p>A young man died after injuries received in a row, and his friend
  says:&mdash;'It is dreadful about the poor boy: they made at him in the
  house and killed him there; then they dragged him out on the road and
  killed him entirely, so that he lived for only three days after. I
  wouldn't mind if they shot him at once and put an end to him: but to be
  murdering him like that&mdash;it is terrible.'</p>

  <p>The fairy says to Billy:&mdash;'I am a thousand years old to-day, and
  I think it is time for me to get <!-- Page 135 --><span

  Billy replies:&mdash;'I think it is quite time without any kind of doubt
  at all.' (Crofton Croker.)</p>

  <p>The squire walks in to Patrick's cabin: and Patrick says:&mdash;'Your
  honour's honour is quite welcome entirely.' (Crofton Croker.)</p>

  <p>An expression you will often hear even in Dublin:&mdash;'Lend me the
  loan of your umbrella.'</p>

  expression is heard everywhere in Ireland.</p>

  <p>We have in Ireland an inveterate habit&mdash;from the highest to the
  lowest&mdash;educated and uneducated&mdash;of constantly interjecting the
  words 'you know' into our conversation as a mere expletive, without any
  particular meaning:&mdash;'I had it all the time, you know, in my pocket:
  he had a seat, you know, that he could arrange like a chair: I was
  walking, you know, into town yesterday, when I met your father.' 'Why in
  the world did you lend him such a large sum of money?' 'Well, you know,
  the fact is I couldn't avoid it.' This expression is often varied to
  'don't you know.'</p>

  <p>In Munster a question is often introduced by the <!-- Page 136
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>{136}</span>words 'I don't
  know,' always shortened to <i>I'd'no</i> (three syllables with the

  <p>Some of the items in this chapter would fit very well in the last; but
  this makes no matter; for 'good punch drinks well from either dandy or

  <p>You attempt in vain to bring a shameless coarse-minded man to a sense
  of the evil he has done:&mdash;'Ye might as well put a blister on a
  hedgehog.' (Tyrone.)</p>

  <p>You're as cross all this day as <i>a bag of cats</i>.</p>

  <p>If a man is inclined to threaten much but never acts up to his
  threats&mdash;severe in word but mild in act:&mdash;His bark is worse
  than his bite.</p>

  <p>That turf is as dry as a bone (very common in Munster.)
  <i>Bone-dry</i> is the term in Ulster.</p>

  <p>When a woman has very thick legs, thick almost down to the feet, she
  is 'like a Mullingar heifer, beef to the heels.' The plains of Westmeath
  round Mullingar are noted for fattening cattle. <!-- Page 137 --><span

  <p>He died roaring like Doran's bull.</p>

  <p>A person restless, uneasy, fidgety, and impatient for the time being,
  is 'like a hen on a hot griddle.'</p>

  <p>Of a scapegrace it is said he is past <i>grace</i> like a limeburner's
  brogue (shoe). The point will be caught up when it is remembered that
  <i>grease</i> is pronounced <i>grace</i> in Ireland.</p>

  <p>You're as blind as a bat.</p>

  <p>When a person is boastful&mdash;magnifies all his
  belongings&mdash;'all his geese are swans.'</p>

  <p>She has a tongue that would <i>clip a hedge</i>. The tongue of another
  would <i>clip clouts</i> (cut rags). (Ulster.)</p>

  <p>He went <i>as fast as hops</i>. When a fellow is hopping along on one

  <p>Of a coarse ill-mannered man who uses unmannerly language:&mdash;'What

  <p>A person who seems to be getting smaller is growing down like a cow's
  tail.</p>

  <p>Of a wiry muscular active man people say 'he's as hard as nails.'</p>

  <p>A person who acts inconsiderately and rudely without any restraint and

  <p>When a person clinches an argument, or puts a hard fact in opposition,
  or a poser of any kind hard to answer:&mdash;'Put that in your pipe and
  smoke it.' <!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>'My stomach is as dry as a lime-burner's wig.' There were professional

  <p>I want a drink badly: my throat is as dry as the pipe of Dick the

  <p>Poor Manus was terribly frightened; he stood shaking <i>like a dog in

  <p>Spending your money before you get it&mdash;going in debt till pay day

  <p>He hasn't as much land as would sod a lark; as much as would make a

  <p>That fellow is <i>as crooked an a ram's horn</i>; i.e. he is a great
  schemer. Applied also in general to anything crooked.</p>

  <p>'Do you mean to say he is a thief?' 'Yes I do; last year he stole
  sheep <i>as often as he has fingers and toes</i>' (meaning very
  often).</p>

  <p>You're as welcome as the flowers of May.</p>

  <p>'Biddy, are the potatoes boiling?' Biddy takes off the lid to look,
  and replies 'The <i>white horses</i> are on 'em ma'am.' The <i>white
  horses</i> are patches of froth on the top of the pot when the potatoes
  are coming near boiling.</p>

  <p>That's as firm as the Rock of Cashel&mdash;as firm as the hob of

  <p>That man would tell lies as fast as a horse would trot.</p>

  <p>A person who does his business briskly and energetically 'works like a
  hatter'&mdash;'works like a <!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  of these men plying their trade.</p>

  <p>A conceited fellow having a dandy way of lifting and placing his legs
  and feet in moving about 'walks like a hen in stubbles.'</p>

  <p>A person who is cool and collected under trying circumstances is 'as
  cool as a cucumber.' Here the alliteration helps to popularise the
  saying.</p>

  <p>I must put up the horses now and have them 'as clean as a new pin' for
  the master.</p>

  <p>A person who does good either to an individual or to his family or to
  the community, but afterwards spoils it all by some contrary course of
  conduct, is like a cow that fills the pail, but kicks it over in the
  end.</p>

  <p>A person quite illiterate 'wouldn't know a <b>B</b> from a bull's
  foot.' The catching point here is partly alliteration, and partly that a
  bull's foot has some resemblance to a <b>B</b>.</p>

  <p>Another expression for an illiterate man:&mdash;He wouldn't know a
  <b>C</b> from a chest of drawers&mdash;where there is a weak
  alliteration.</p>

  <p>He'll tell you a story as long as to-day and to-morrow. Long enough:

  <p>'You'll lose that handkerchief <i>as sure as a gun</i>.'</p>

  <p>That furrow is <i>as straight as a die</i>.</p>

  <p>A person who does neither good nor harm&mdash;little ill, little
  good&mdash;is 'like a chip in porridge': almost always said as a
  reproach.</p>

  <p>I was <i>on pins and needles</i> till you came home: i.e. I was very
  uneasy. <!-- Page 142 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>The story went round like wildfire: i.e. circulated rapidly.</p>

  <p>Of a person very thin:&mdash;He's 'as fat as a hen in the

  <p>A man is staggering along&mdash;not with drink:&mdash;That poor fellow
  is 'drunk with hunger like a showman's dog.'</p>

  <p>Dick and Bill are 'as great as inkle-weavers:' a saying very common in
  Limerick and Cork. <i>Inkle</i> is a kind of broad linen tape: a
  Shakespearian word. 'Several pieces of it were formerly woven in the same
  loom, by as many boys, who sat close together on the same seat-board.'
  (Dr. A. Hume.)</p>

  <p>William is 'the spit out of his father's mouth'; i.e. he is strikingly
  like his father either in person or character or both. Another expression
  conveying the same sense:&mdash;'Your father will never die while you are
  alive': and 'he's a chip off the old block.' Still another, though not
  quite so strong:&mdash;'He's his father's son.' Another saying to the
  same effect&mdash;'kind father for him'&mdash;is examined elsewhere.</p>

  <p>'I'm a man in myself like Oliver's bull,' a common saying in my native
  place (in Limerick), and applied to a confident self-helpful person. The

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE MEMORY OF HISTORY AND OF OLD CUSTOMS.</p>

  <p><i>Church</i>, <i>Chapel</i>, <i>Scallan</i>. All through Ireland it
  is customary to call a Protestant place of worship a 'church,' and that
  belonging to Roman Catholics a 'chapel': and this usage not only prevails
  among the people, but has found its way into official documents. For
  instance, take the Ordnance maps. In almost every village and town on the
  map you will <!-- Page 144 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page144"></a>{144}</span>see in one place the word 'Church,' while
  near by is printed 'R.C. Chapel.' This custom has its roots far back in
  the time when it was attempted to extend the doctrines of the Reformation
  to Ireland. Then wherever the authority of the government prevailed, the
  church belonging to the Catholics was taken from them; the priest was
  expelled; and a Protestant minister was installed. But the law went much
  farther, and forbade under fearful penalties the celebration of
  Mass&mdash;penalties for both priest and congregation. As the people had
  now no churches, the custom began of celebrating Mass in the open air,
  always in remote lonely places where there was little fear of discovery.
  Many of these places retain to this day names formed from the Irish word
  <i>Affrionn</i> [affrin], the Mass; such as the mountain called
  Knockanaffrinn in Waterford (the hill of the Mass), Ardanaffrinn,
  Lissanaffrinn, and many others. While Mass was going on, a watcher was
  always placed on an adjacent height to have a look-out for the approach
  of a party of military, or of a spy with the offered reward in view.</p>

  <p>After a long interval however, when the sharp fangs of the Penal Laws
  began to be blunted or drawn, the Catholics commenced to build for
  themselves little places of worship: very timidly at first, and always in
  some out-of-the-way place. But they had many difficulties to contend
  with. Poverty was one of them; for the great body of the congregations
  were labourers or tradesmen, as the Catholic people had been almost
  crushed out of existence, soul and body, for five or six generations, by
  the terrible Penal Laws, which, with careful attention to details,
  omitted nothing <!-- Page 145 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page145"></a>{145}</span>that could impoverish and degrade them.
  But even poverty, bad as it was, never stood decidedly in the way; for
  the buildings were not expensive, and the poor people gladly contributed
  shillings coppers and labour for the luxury of a chapel. A more serious
  obstacle was the refusal of landlords in some districts to lease a plot
  of land for the building. In Donegal and elsewhere they had a movable
  little wooden shed that just sheltered the priest and the sacred
  appliances while he celebrated Mass, and which was wheeled about from
  place to place in the parish wherever required. A shed of this kind was
  called a <i>scallan</i> (Irish: a shield, a protecting shelter). Some of
  these <i>scallans</i> are preserved with reverence to this day, as for
  instance one in Carrigaholt in Clare, where a large district was for many
  years without any Catholic place of worship, as the local landlord
  obstinately refused to let a bit of land. You may now see that very
  <i>scallan</i>&mdash;not much larger than a sentry-box&mdash;beside the
  new chapel in Carrigaholt.</p>

  <p>And so those humble little buildings gradually rose up all over the
  country. Then many of the small towns and villages through the country
  presented this spectacle. In one place was the 'decent church' that had
  formerly belonged to the Catholics, now in possession of a Protestant
  congregation of perhaps half a dozen&mdash;church, minister, and clerk
  maintained by contributions of tithes forced from the Catholic people;
  and not far off a poor little thatched building with clay floor and rough
  walls for a Roman Catholic congregation of 500, 1000, or more, all except
  the few that found room within kneeling on <!-- Page 146 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page146"></a>{146}</span>the ground outside,
  only too glad to be able to be present at Mass under any conditions.</p>

  <p>These little buildings were always called 'chapels,' to distinguish
  them from what were now the Protestant churches. Many of these primitive
  places of worship remained in use to a period within living
  memory&mdash;perhaps some remain still. When I was a boy I generally
  heard Mass in one of them, in Ballyorgan, Co. Limerick: clay floor, no
  seats, walls of rough stone unplastered, thatch not far above our heads.
  Just over the altar was suspended a level canopy of thin boards, to hide
  the thatch from the sacred spot: and on its under surface was roughly
  painted by some rustic artist a figure of a dove&mdash;emblematic of the
  Holy Ghost&mdash;which to my childish fancy was a work of art equal at
  least to anything ever executed by Michael Angelo. Many and many a time I
  heard exhortations from that poor altar, sometimes in English, sometimes
  in Irish, by the Rev. Darby Buckley, the parish priest of Glenroe (of
  which Ballyorgan formed a part), delivered with such earnestness and
  power as to produce extraordinary effects on the congregation. You saw
  men and women in tears everywhere around you, and at the few words of
  unstudied peroration they flung themselves on their knees in a passionate
  burst of piety and sorrow. Ah, God be with Father Darby Buckley: a small
  man, full of fire and energy: somewhat overbearing, and rather severe in
  judging of small transgressions; but all the same, a great and saintly
  parish priest.</p>

  <p>That little chapel has long been superseded by a solid structure,
  suitable to the neighbourhood and its people. <!-- Page 147 --><span

  <p>What has happened in the neighbouring town of Kilfinane is still more
  typical of the advance of the Catholics. There also stood a large
  thatched chapel with a clay floor: and the Catholics were just beginning
  to emerge from their state of servility when the Rev. Father Sheehy was
  appointed parish priest about the beginning of the last century. He was a
  tall man of splendid physique: when I was a boy I knew him in his old
  age, and even then you could not help admiring his imposing figure. At
  that time the lord of the soil was Captain Oliver, one of that
  Cromwellian family to whom was granted all the district belonging to
  their Catholic predecessors, Sir John Ponsonby and Sir Edward Fitzharris,
  both of whom were impeached and disinherited,</p>

  <p>On the Monday morning following the new priest's first Mass he
  strolled down to have a good view of the chapel and grounds, and was much
  astonished to find in the chapel yard a cartload of oats in sheaf, in
  charge of a man whom he recognized as having been at Mass on the day
  before. He called him over and questioned him, on which the man told him
  that the captain had sent him with the oats to have it threshed on the
  chapel floor, as he always did. The priest was amazed and indignant, and
  instantly ordered the man off the grounds, threatening him with personal
  chastisement, which&mdash;considering the priest's brawny figure and
  determined look&mdash;he perhaps feared more than bell book and candle.
  The exact words Father Sheehy used were, 'If ever I find you here again
  with a load of oats or a load of anything else, <i>I'll break your back
  for you</i>: and then I'll go up and break your master's back too!' The
  <!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page148"></a>{148}</span>fellow went off hot foot with his load,
  and told his master, expecting all sorts of ructions. But the captain
  took it in good part, and had his oats threshed elsewhere: and as a
  matter of fact he and the priest soon after met and became
  acquainted.</p>

  <p>In sending his corn to be threshed on the chapel floor, it is right to
  remark that the captain intended no offence and no undue exercise of
  power; and besides he was always careful to send a couple of men on
  Saturday evening to sweep the floor and clean up the chapel for the
  service of next day. But it was a custom of some years' standing, and
  Father Sheehy's predecessor never considered it necessary to expostulate.
  It is likely enough indeed that he himself got a few scratches in his day
  from the Penal Laws, and thought it as well to let matters go on
  quietly.</p>

  <p>After a little time Father Sheehy had a new church built, a solid
  slate-roofed structure suitable for the time, which, having stood for
  nearly a century, was succeeded by the present church. This, which was
  erected after almost incredible labour and perseverance in collecting the
  funds by the late parish priest, the Very Rev. Patrick Lee, V.F., is one
  of the most beautiful parish churches in all Ireland. What has happened
  in Ballyorgan and Kilfinane may be considered a type of what has taken
  place all over the country. Within the short space of a century the poor
  thatched clay-floor chapels have been everywhere replaced by solid or
  beautiful or stately churches, which have sprung up all through Ireland
  as if by magic, through the exertions of the pastors, and the
  contributions of the people. <!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page149"></a>{149}</span></p>

  <p>This popular application of the terms 'chapel' and 'church'
  found&mdash;and still finds&mdash;expression in many ways. Thus a man who
  neglects religion: 'he never goes to Church, Mass, or Meeting' (this last
  word meaning Non-conformist Service). A man says, 'I didn't see Jack
  Delany at Mass to-day': 'Oh, didn't you hear about him&mdash;sure he's
  going to <i>church</i> now' (i.e. he has turned Protestant). 'And do they
  never talk of those [young people] who go to church' [i.e. Protestants].
  (Knocknagow.)</p>

  <p>The term 'chapel' has so ingrained itself in my mind that to this hour
  the word instinctively springs to my lips when I am about to mention a
  Catholic place of worship; and I always feel some sort of hesitation or
  reluctance in substituting the word 'church.' I positively could not
  bring myself to say, 'Come, it is time now to set out for church': it
  must be either 'Mass' or 'the chapel.'</p>

  <p>I see no reason against our retaining these two words, with their
  distinction; for they tell in brief a vivid chapter in our history.</p>

  <p><i>Hedge-Schools.</i> Evil memories of the bad old penal days come
  down to us clustering round this word. At the end of the seventeenth
  century, among many other penal enactments,<a name="NtA4"
  href="#Nt4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> a law was passed that Catholics were not
  to be educated. Catholic schoolmasters were forbidden to teach, either in
  schools or in private houses; and Catholic parents were forbidden to send
  their children to any foreign country to be educated&mdash;all under
  heavy penalties; from which it will be seen that care was taken to <!--
  Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page150"></a>{150}</span>deprive Catholics&mdash;as
  such&mdash;altogether of the means of education.</p>

  <p>But priests and schoolmasters and people combined all through the
  country&mdash;and not without some measure of success&mdash;to evade this
  unnatural law. Schools were kept secretly, though at great risk, in
  remote places&mdash;up in the mountain glens or in the middle of bogs.
  Half a dozen young men with spades and shovels built up a rude cabin in a
  few hours, which served the purpose of a schoolhouse: and from the common
  plan of erecting these in the shelter of hedges, walls, and groves, the
  schools came to be known as 'Hedge Schools.' These hedge schools held on
  for generations, and kept alive the lamp of learning, which burned
  on&mdash;but in a flickering ineffective sort of way&mdash;'burned
  through long ages of darkness and storm'&mdash;till at last the
  restrictions were removed, and Catholics were permitted to have schools
  of their own openly and without let or hindrance. Then the ancient
  hereditary love of learning was free to manifest itself once more; and
  schools sprang up all over the country, each conducted by a private
  teacher who lived on the fees paid by his pupils. Moreover, the old
  designation was retained; for these schools, no longer held in wild
  places, were called&mdash;as they are sometimes called to this
  day&mdash;'hedge schools.'</p>

  <p>The schools that arose in this manner, which were of different
  classes, were spread all over the country during the eighteenth century
  and the first half of the nineteenth. The most numerous were little
  elementary schools, which will be described farther on. The higher class
  of schools, which <!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page151"></a>{151}</span>answered to what we now call Intermediate
  schools, were found all over the southern half of Ireland, especially in
  Munster. Some were for classics, some for science, and not a few for
  both; nearly all conducted by men of learning and ability; and they were
  everywhere eagerly attended. 'Many of the students had professions in
  view, some intended for the priesthood, for which the classical schools
  afforded an admirable preparation; some seeking to become medical
  doctors, teachers, surveyors, &amp;c. But a large proportion were the
  sons of farmers, tradesmen, shopkeepers, or others, who had no particular
  end in view, but, with the instincts of the days of old, studied classics
  or mathematics for the pure love of learning. I knew many of that
  class.</p>

  <p>'These schools continued to exist down to our own time, till they were
  finally broken up by the famine of 1847. In my own immediate
  neighbourhood were some of them, in which I received a part of my early
  education; and I remember with pleasure several of my old teachers; rough
  and unpolished men many of them, but excellent solid scholars and full of
  enthusiasm for learning&mdash;which enthusiasm they communicated to their
  pupils. All the students were adults or grown boys; and there was no
  instruction in the elementary subjects&mdash;reading, writing, and
  arithmetic&mdash;as no scholar attended who had not sufficiently mastered
  these. Among the students were always half a dozen or more "poor
  scholars" from distant parts of Ireland, who lived free in the hospitable
  farmers' houses all round: just as the scholars from Britain and
  elsewhere <!-- Page 152 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page152"></a>{152}</span>were supported in the time of
  Bede&mdash;twelve centuries before.'<a name="NtA5"
  href="#Nt5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In every town all over Munster there was&mdash;down to a period well
  within my memory&mdash;one of those schools, for either classics or
  science&mdash;and in most indeed there were two, one for each branch,
  besides one or more smaller schools for the elementary branches, taught
  by less distinguished men.</p>

  <p>There was extraordinary intellectual activity among the schoolmasters
  of those times: some of them indeed thought and dreamed and talked of
  nothing else but learning; and if you met one of them and fell into
  conversation, he was sure to give you a strong dose as long as you
  listened, heedless as to whether you understood him or not. In their eyes
  learning was the main interest of the world. They often met on Saturdays;
  and on these occasions certain subjects were threshed out in discussion
  by the principal men. There were often formal disputations when two of
  the chief men of a district met, each attended by a number of his senior
  pupils, to discuss some knotty point in dispute, of classics, science, or
  grammar.</p>

  <p>There was one subject that long divided the teachers of Limerick and
  Tipperary into two hostile camps of learning&mdash;the verb <i>To be</i>.
  There is a well-known rule of grammar that 'the verb <i>to be</i> takes
  the same case after it as goes before it.' One party headed by the two
  Dannahys, father and son, very scholarly men, of north Limerick, held
  that the verb <!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page153"></a>{153}</span><i>to be governed</i> the case following;
  while the other, at the head of whom was Mr. Patrick Murray of Kilfinane
  in south Limerick, maintained that the correspondence of the two cases,
  after and before, was mere <i>agreement</i>, not <i>government</i>. And
  they argued with as much earnestness as the Continental Nominalists and
  Realists of an older time.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the discussions on various points found their way into
  print, either in newspapers or in special broadsheets coarsely printed;
  and in these the mutual criticisms were by no means gentle.</p>

  <p>There were poets too, who called in the aid of the muses to help their
  cause. One of these, who was only a schoolmaster in embryo&mdash;one of
  Dannahy's pupils&mdash;wrote a sort of pedagogic Dunciad, in which he
  impaled most of the prominent teachers of south Limerick who were
  followers of Murray. Here is how he deals with Mr. Murray
  himself:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Lo, forward he comes, in oblivion long lain,</p>
      <p>Great Murray, the soul of the light-headed train;</p>
      <p>A punster, a mimic, a jibe, and a quiz,</p>
      <p>His acumen stamped on his all-knowing phiz:</p>
      <p>He declares that the subsequent noun should <i>agree</i></p>
      <p>With the noun or the pronoun preceding <i>To be</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Another teacher, from Mountrussell, was great in astronomy, and was
  continually holding forth on his favourite subject and his own knowledge
  of it. The poet makes him say:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>The course of a comet with ease I can trail,</p>
      <p>And with my ferula I measure his tail;</p>
      <p>On the wings of pure Science without a balloon</p>
      <p>Like Baron Munchausen I visit the moon;</p>
      <p>Along the ecliptic and great milky way,</p>
      <p>In mighty excursions I soaringly stray;</p>
      <p>With legs wide extended on the poles I can stand,</p>
      <p>And like marbles the planets I toss in my hand.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page154"></a>{154}</span></p>

  <p>The poet then, returning to his own words, goes on to say</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>The gods being amused at his logical blab,</p>
      <p>They built him a castle near Cancer the Crab.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But this same astronomer, though having as we see a free residence,
  never went to live there: he emigrated to Australia where he entered the
  priesthood and ultimately became a bishop.</p>

  <p>One of the ablest of all the Munster teachers of that period was Mr.
  Patrick Murray, already mentioned, who kept his school in the upper story
  of the market house of Kilfinane in south Limerick. He was particularly
  eminent in English Grammar and Literature. I went to his school for one
  year when I was very young, and I am afraid I was looked upon as very
  slow, especially in his pet subject Grammar. I never could be got to
  parse correctly such complications as 'I might, could, would, or should
  have been loving.' Mr. Murray was a poet too. I will give here a humorous
  specimen of one of his parodies. It was on the occasion of his coming
  home one night very late, and not as sober as he should be, when he got
  'Ballyhooly' and no mistake from his wife. It was after Moore's 'The
  valley lay smiling before me'; and the following are two verses of the
  original with the corresponding two of the parody, of which the opening
  line is 'The candle was lighting before me.' But I have the whole parody
  in my memory.</p>

  <p>I was a pupil in four of the higher class of schools, in which was
  finished my school education such as it was. The best conducted was that
  of Mr. John Condon which was held in the upper story of the market house
  in Mitchelstown, Co. Cork, a large apartment fully and properly
  furnished, forming an admirable schoolroom. This was one of the best <!--
  Page 156 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page156"></a>{156}</span>schools in Munster. It was truly an
  excellent Intermediate school, and was attended by all the school-going
  students of the town, Protestant as well as Catholic&mdash;with many from
  the surrounding country. Mr. Condon was a cultured and scholarly man, and
  he taught science, including mathematics, surveying, and the use of the
  globes, and also geography and English grammar. He had an assistant who
  taught Greek and Latin. I was one of the very few who attempted the
  double work of learning both science and classics. To learn surveying we
  went once a week&mdash;on Saturdays&mdash;to Mr. Condon's farm near the
  town, with theodolite and chain, in the use of which we all&mdash;i.e.
  those of us learning the subject&mdash;had to take part in turn. Mr.
  Condon was thorough master of the science of the Use of the Globes, a
  very beautiful branch of education which gave the learners a knowledge of
  the earth, of the solar system, and of astronomy in general. But the use
  of the globes no longer forms a part of our school teaching:&mdash;more's
  the pity.</p>

  <p>The year before going to Mitchelstown I attended a science school of a
  very different character kept by Mr. Simon Cox in Galbally, a little
  village in Limerick under the shadow of the Galty Mountains. This was a
  very rough sort of school, but mathematics and the use of the globes were
  well taught. There were about forty students. Half a dozen were grown
  boys, of whom I was one; the rest were men, mostly young, but a few in
  middle life&mdash;schoolmasters bent on improving their knowledge of
  science in preparation for opening schools in their own parts of the
  country. <!-- Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page157"></a>{157}</span></p>

  <p>In that school, and indeed in all schools like it through the country,
  there were 'poor scholars,' a class already spoken of, who paid for
  nothing&mdash;they were taught for nothing and freely entertained, with
  bed, supper, and breakfast in the farmers' houses of the neighbourhood.
  We had four or five of these, not one of whom knew in the morning where
  he was to sleep at night. When school was over they all set out in
  different directions, and called at the farmers' houses to ask for
  lodging; and although there might be a few refusals, all were sure to be
  put up for the night. They were expected however to help the children at
  their lessons for the elementary school before the family retired.</p>

  <p>In some cases if a farmer was favourably impressed with a poor
  scholar's manner and character he kept him&mdash;lodging and feeding him
  in his house&mdash;during the whole time of his schooling&mdash;the young
  fellow paying nothing of course, but always helping the little ones at
  their lessons. As might be expected many of these poor scholars were made
  of the best stuff; and I have now in my eye one who was entertained for a
  couple of years in my grandmother's house, and who subsequently became
  one of the ablest and most respected teachers in Munster.</p>

  <p>Let us remark here that this entertainment of poor scholars was not
  looked upon in the light of a charity: it was regarded as a duty; for the
  instinct ran in the people's blood derived from ancient times when
  Ireland was the 'Island of Saints and Scholars.'<a name="NtA6"
  href="#Nt6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> It was a custom of long standing; for <!--
  Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page158"></a>{158}</span>the
  popular feeling in favour of learning was always maintained, even through
  the long dark night of the Penal Laws.</p>

  <p>'Tis marvellous how I escaped smoking: I had many opportunities in
  early life, of which surely the best of all was this Galbally school. For
  every one I think smoked except the half dozen boys, and even of these
  one or two were learning industriously. And each scholar took his smoke
  without ceremony in the schoolroom whenever he pleased, so that the room
  was never quite clear of the fragrant blue haze. I remember well on one
  occasion, a class of ten, of whom I was one, sitting round the master,
  whose chair stood on a slightly elevated platform, and all, both master
  and scholars, were smoking, except myself. The lesson was on some of the
  hard problems in Luby's Euclid, which we had been unable to solve, and of
  which Mr. Cox was now showing us the solutions. He made his diagram for
  each problem on a large slate turned towards us; and as we knew the
  meaning of almost every turn and twist of his pencil as he developed the
  solution, he spoke very little; and we followed him over the diagram,
  <i>twigging</i> readily the function of every point, line, angle, and
  circle. And when at last someone had to ask a brief question, Mr. Cox
  removed his pipe with his left hand and uttered a few monosyllabic words,
  which enabled us to pick up the lost thread; then replacing the pipe, he
  went on in silence as before.</p>

  <p>I was the delight and joy of that school; for I generally carried in
  my pocket a little fife from which I could roll off jigs, reels,
  hornpipes, hop-jigs, <!-- Page 159 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page159"></a>{159}</span>song tunes, &amp;c., without limit. The
  school was held in a good-sized room in the second story of a house, of
  which the landlady and her family lived in the kitchen and bedrooms
  beneath&mdash;on the ground-floor. Some dozen or more of the scholars
  were always in attendance in the mornings half an hour or so before the
  arrival of the master, of whom I was sure to be one&mdash;what could they
  do without me?&mdash;and then out came the fife, and they cleared the
  floor for a dance. It was simply magnificent to see and hear these
  athletic fellows dancing on the bare boards with their thick-soled
  well-nailed heavy shoes&mdash;so as to shake the whole house. And not one
  in the lot was more joyous than I was; for they were mostly good dancers
  and did full justice to my spirited strains. At last in came the master:
  there was no cessation; and he took his seat, looking on complacently
  till that bout was finished, when I put up my fife, and the serious
  business of the day was commenced.</p>

  <p>We must now have a look at the elementary schools&mdash;for teaching
  Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic to children. They were by far the most
  numerous, for there was one in every village and hamlet, and two or three
  or more in every town. These schools were very primitive and rude. The
  parish priests appointed the teachers, and kept an eye over the schools,
  which were generally mixed&mdash;boys and girls. There was no attempt at
  classification, and little or no class teaching; the children were taught
  individually. Each bought whatever Reading Book he or his parents
  pleased. So there was an odd mixture. A very usual book was a 'Spelling
  and <!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page160"></a>{160}</span>Reading book,' which was pretty sure to
  have the story of Tommy and Harry. In this there were almost always a
  series of lessons headed 'Principles of Politeness,' which were in fact
  selected from the writings of Chesterfield. In these there were elaborate
  instructions how we were to comport ourselves in a drawing room; and we
  were to be particularly careful when entering not to let our sword get
  between our legs and trip us up. We were to bear offences or insults from
  our companions as long as possible, but if a fellow went too far we were
  to 'call him out.' It must be confessed there was some of the 'calling
  out' business&mdash;though not in Chesterfield's sense; and if the
  fellows didn't fight with pistols and swords, they gave and got some
  black eyes and bloody noses. But this was at their peril; for if the
  master came to hear of it, they were sure to get further punishment,
  though not exactly on the face.</p>

  <p>Then some scholars had 'The Seven Champions of Christendom,' others
  'St. George and the Dragon,' or 'Don Bellianis of Greece,' 'The Seven
  Wonders of the World,' or 'The History of Reynard the Fox,' a great
  favourite, translated from an old German mock heroic. And sometimes I
  have seen girls learning to read from a Catholic Prayerbook. Each had his
  lesson for next day marked in pencil by the master, which he was to
  prepare. The pupils were called up one by one each to read his own
  lesson&mdash;whole or part&mdash;for the master, and woe betide him if he
  stumbled at too many words.</p>

  <p>The schools were nearly always held in the small ordinary
  dwelling-houses of the people, or perhaps a <!-- Page 161 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page161"></a>{161}</span>barn was utilised: at
  any rate there was only one room. Not unfrequently the family that owned
  the house lived in that same room&mdash;the kitchen&mdash;and went on
  with their simple household work while the school was buzzing about their
  ears, neither in any way interfering with the other. There was hardly
  ever any <i>school</i> furniture&mdash;no desks of any kind. There were
  seats enough, of a motley kind&mdash;one or two ordinary forms placed at
  the walls: some chairs with <i>sugaun</i> seats; several little stools,
  and perhaps a few big stones. In fine weather the scholars spent much of
  their time in the front yard in the open air, where they worked their
  sums or wrote their copies with the copybooks resting on their knees.</p>

  <p>When the priest visited one of these schools, which he did whenever in
  the neighbourhood, it was a great event for both master and scholars.
  Conor Leahy was one of those masters&mdash;a very rough diamond indeed,
  though a good teacher and not over severe&mdash;whose school was in
  Fanningstown near my home. One day Billy Moroney ran in breathless, with
  eyes starting out of his head, to say&mdash;as well as he could get it
  out&mdash;that Father Bourke was coming up the road. Now we were
  all&mdash;master and scholars&mdash;mortally afraid of Father Bourke and
  his heavy brows&mdash;though never was fear more misplaced (p. <a
  href="#page71">71</a>). The master instantly bounced up and warned us to
  be of good behaviour&mdash;not to stir hand or foot&mdash;while the
  priest was present. He happened to be standing at the fireplace; and he
  finished up the brief and vigorous exhortation by thumping his fist down
  on the hob:&mdash;'By this stone, if one of ye opens your mouth while the
  priest is here, I'll knock your <!-- Page 162 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page162"></a>{162}</span>brains out after he's gone away!' That
  visit passed off in great style.</p>

  <p>These elementary teachers, or 'hedge teachers,' as they were commonly
  called, were a respectable body of men, and were well liked by the
  people. Many of them were rough and uncultivated in speech, but all had
  sufficient scholarship for their purpose, and many indeed very much more.
  They were poor, for they had to live on the small fees of their pupils;
  but they loved learning&mdash;so far as their attainments went&mdash;and
  inspired their pupils with the same love. These private elementary
  schools gradually diminished in numbers as the National Schools spread,
  and finally disappeared about the year 1850.</p>

  <p>These were the schools of the small villages and hamlets, which were
  to be found everywhere&mdash;all over the country: and such were the
  schools that the Catholic people were only too glad to have after the
  chains had been struck off&mdash;the very schools in which many men that
  afterwards made a figure in the world received their early education.</p>

  <p>The elementary schools of the towns were of a higher class. The
  attendance was larger; there were generally desks and seats of the
  ordinary kind; and the higher classes were commonly taught something
  beyond Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic; such as Grammar, or
  Book-keeping, with occasionally a spice of Euclid, Mensuration,
  Surveying, or Algebra.</p>

  <p>It very often happened that the school took its prevailing tone from
  the taste of the master; so that the higher classes in one were great at
  Grammar, those of another at Penmanship, some at Higher <!-- Page 163
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page163"></a>{163}</span>Arithmetic,
  some at 'Short Accounts' (i.e. short methods of Mental Arithmetic),
  others at Book-keeping. For there were then no fixed Programmes and no
  Inspectors, and each master (in addition to the ordinary elementary
  subjects) taught just whatever he liked best, and lit up his own special
  tastes among his pupils.</p>

  <p>So far have these words, <i>church</i>, <i>chapel</i>, <i>scallan</i>,
  <i>hedge-school</i>, led us through the bye-ways of History; and perhaps
  the reader will not be sorry to turn to something else.</p>

  <p><i>Rattle the hasp: Tent pot.</i> During Fair-days&mdash;all over the
  country&mdash;there were half a dozen or more booths or tents on the fair
  field, put up by publicans, in which was always uproarious fun; for they
  were full of people&mdash;young and old&mdash;eating and drinking,
  dancing and singing and match-making. There was sure to be a piper or a
  fiddler for the young people; and usually a barn door, lifted off its
  hinges&mdash;hasp and all&mdash;was laid flat, or perhaps two or three
  doors were laid side by side, for the dancers; a custom adopted elsewhere
  as well as in fairs&mdash;</p>

  <p>There was one particular tune&mdash;a jig&mdash;which, from the custom
  of dancing on a door, got the name of 'Rattle the hasp.'</p>

  <p>Just at the mouth of the tent it was common to have a great pot hung
  on hooks over a fire sunk in the ground underneath, and full of pigs
  cheeks, flitches of bacon, pigs' legs and <i>croobeens</i> galore, kept
  <!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page164"></a>{164}</span>perpetually boiling like the chiefs'
  caldrons of old, so that no one need be hungry or thirsty so long as he
  had a penny in his pocket. These pots were so large that they came to be
  spoken of as a symbol of plenty: 'Why you have as much bacon and cabbage
  there as would fill a tent-pot.'</p>

  <p>One day&mdash;long long ago&mdash;at the fair of Ardpatrick in
  Limerick&mdash;I was then a little boy, but old enough to laugh at the
  story when I heard it in the fair&mdash;a fellow with a wattle in his
  hand having a sharp iron spike on the end, walked up to one of these
  tent-pots during the momentary absence of the owner, and thrusting the
  spike into a pig's cheek, calmly stood there holding the stick in his
  hand till the man came up. 'What are you doing there?'&mdash;When the
  other looking sheepish and frightened:&mdash;'Wisha sir I have a little
  bit of a pig's cheek here that isn't done well enough all out, and I was
  thinking that may be you wouldn't mind if I gave it a couple of
  <i>biles</i> in your pot.' 'Be off out of that you impudent blaa-guard,
  yourself and your pig's cheek, or I'll break every bone in your body.'
  The poor innocent boy said nothing, but lifted the stick out of the pot
  with the pig's cheek on the end of it, and putting it on his shoulder,
  walked off through the fair with meek resignation.</p>

  <p>More than a thousand years ago it was usual in Ireland for ladies who
  went to banquets with their husbands or other near relations to wear a
  mask. This lady's mask was called <i>fethal</i>, which is the old form of
  the word, modern form <i>fidil</i>. The memory of this old custom is
  preserved in the name now given to a mask by both English and Irish
  speakers&mdash;<i>i fiddle</i>, <i>eye-fiddle</i>, <i>hi-fiddle</i>, or
  <i>hy-fiddle</i> (the first two <!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page165"></a>{165}</span>being the most correct). The full Irish
  name is <i>aghaidh-fidil</i>, of which the first part <i>agaidh</i>,
  pronounced <i>i</i> or <i>eye</i>, means the
  face:&mdash;<i>agaidh-fidil</i>, 'face-mask.' This word was quite common
  in Munster sixty or seventy years ago, when we, boys, made our own
  <i>i-fiddles</i>, commonly of brown paper, daubed in
  colour&mdash;hideous-looking things when worn&mdash;enough to frighten a
  horse from his oats.</p>

  <p>Among those who fought against the insurgents in Ireland during the
  Rebellion of 1798 were some German cavalry called Hessians. They wore a
  sort of long boots so remarkable that boots of the same pattern are to
  this day called <i>Hessian boots</i>. One day in a skirmish one of the
  rebels shot down a Hessian, and brought away his fine boots as his lawful
  prize. One of his comrades asked him for the boots: and he answered 'Kill
  a Hessian for yourself,' which has passed into a proverb. When by labour
  and trouble you obtain anything which another seeks to get from you on
  easy terms, you answer <i>Kill a Hessian for yourself</i>.</p>

  <p>During the War of the Confederation in Ireland in the seventeenth
  century Murrogh O'Brien earl of Inchiquin took the side of the Government
  against his own countrymen, and committed such merciless ravages among
  the people that he is known to this day as 'Murrogh the Burner'; and his
  name has passed into a proverb for outrage and cruelty. When a person
  persists in doing anything likely to bring on heavy punishment of some
  kind, the people say 'If you go on in that way <i>you'll see
  Murrogh</i>,' meaning 'you will suffer for it.' Or when a person seems
  scared or frightened:&mdash;'He saw Murrogh or <!-- Page 166 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page166"></a>{166}</span>the bush next to him.'
  The original sayings are in Irish, of which these are translations, which
  however are now heard oftener than the Irish.</p>

  <p>In Armagh where Murrogh is not known they say in a similar sense,
  'You'll catch Lanty,' Lanty no doubt being some former local bully.</p>

  <p>When one desires to give another a particularly evil wish he says,
  'The curse of Cromwell on you!' So that Cromwell's atrocities are stored
  up in the people's memories to this day, in the form of a proverb.</p>

  <p>In Ulster they say 'The curse of <i>Crummie</i>.'</p>

  <p>'Were you talking to Tim in town to-day?' 'No, but I saw him <i>from
  me</i> as the soldier saw Bunratty.' Bunratty a strong castle in Co.
  Clare, so strong that besiegers often had to content themselves with
  viewing it from a distance. 'Seeing a person from me' means seeing him at
  a distance. 'Did you meet your cousin James in the fair to-day?' 'Oh I
  just caught sight of him <i>from me</i> for a second, but I wasn't
  speaking to him.'</p>

  <p><i>Sweating-House.</i>&mdash;We know that the Turkish bath is of
  recent introduction in these countries. But the hot-air or vapour bath,
  which is much the same thing, was well known in Ireland from very early
  times, and was used as a cure for rheumatism down to a few years ago. The
  structures in which these baths were given are known by the name of
  <i>tigh 'n alluis</i> [teenollish], or in English, 'sweating-house'
  (<i>allus</i>, 'sweat'). They are still well known in the northern parts
  of Ireland&mdash;small houses entirely of stone, from five to seven feet
  long inside, with a low little door through which one must creep: <!--
  Page 167 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page167"></a>{167}</span>always placed remote from habitations: and
  near by was commonly a pool or tank of water four or five feet deep. They
  were used in this way. A great fire of turf was kindled inside till the
  house became heated like an oven; after which the embers and ashes were
  swept out, and water was splashed on the stones, which produced a thick
  warm vapour. Then the person, wrapping himself in a blanket, crept in and
  sat down on a bench of sods, after which the door was closed up. He
  remained there an hour or so till he was in a profuse perspiration: and
  then creeping out, plunged right into the cold water; after emerging from
  which he was well rubbed till he became warm. After several baths at
  intervals of some days he commonly got cured. Persons are still living
  who used these baths or saw them used. (See the chapter on 'Ancient Irish
  Medicine' in 'Smaller Soc. Hist. of Anc. Ireland,' from which the above
  passage is taken.)</p>

  <p>The lurking conviction that times long ago were better than at
  present&mdash;a belief in 'the good old times'&mdash;is indicated in the
  common opening to a story:&mdash;'Long and merry ago, there lived a
  king,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>'That poor man is as thin as a <i>whipping</i> post': a very general
  saying in Ireland. Preserving the memory of the old custom of tying
  culprits to a firm post in order to be whipped. A whipping post received
  many of the slashes, and got gradually worn down.</p>

  <p>The hardiness of the northern rovers&mdash;the Danes&mdash;who made a
  great figure in Ireland, as in England and elsewhere, is still
  remembered, after nine or ten centuries, in the sayings of our people.
  Scores of <!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page168"></a>{168}</span>times I heard such expressions as the
  following:&mdash;'Ah shut that door: there's a breeze in through it that
  <i>would perish the Danes</i>.'</p>

  <p>The cardinal points are designated on the supposition that the face is
  turned to the east: a custom which has descended in Ireland from the
  earliest times of history and tradition, and which also prevailed among
  other ancient nations. Hence in Irish 'east' is 'front'; 'west' is
  'behind' or 'back'; north is 'left hand'; and south is 'right hand.' The
  people sometimes import these terms into English. 'Where is the tooth?'
  says the dentist. 'Just here sir, in the <i>west</i> of my jaw,' replies
  the patient&mdash;meaning at the back of the jaw.</p>

  <p>Tailors were made the butt of much good-natured harmless raillery,
  often founded on the well-known fact that a tailor is the ninth part of a
  man. If a person leaves little after a meal, or little material after any
  work&mdash;that is 'tailor's leavings'; alluding to an alleged custom of
  the craft. According to this calumny your tailor, when sending home your
  finished suit, sends with it a few little scraps as what was left of the
  cloth you gave him, though he had really much left, which he has
  cribbed.</p>

  <p>When you delay the performance of any work, or business with some
  secret object in view, you 'put the pot in the tailor's link.' Formerly
  tailors commonly worked in the houses of the families who bought their
  own material and employed them to make the clothes. The custom was to
  work till supper time, when their day ended. Accordingly the good
  housewife often hung the pot-hangers on the highest hook or link of the
  pot-hooks so as to raise <!-- Page 169 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page169"></a>{169}</span>the supper-pot well up from the fire and
  delay the boiling. (Ulster.)</p>

  <p>The following two old rhymes are very common:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Four and twenty tailors went out to kill a snail,</p>
      <p>The biggest of them all put his foot upon his tail&mdash;</p>
      <p>The snail put out his horns just like a cow:</p>
      <p class="hg1">'O Lord says the tailor we're all killed now!'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>As I was going to Dub-l-in</p>
      <p class="i2">I met a pack of tailors,</p>
      <p>I put them in my pocket,</p>
      <p class="i2">In fear the ducks might <i>ait</i> them.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the Co. Down the Roman Catholics are called 'back-o'-the-hill
  folk': an echo of the Plantations of James I&mdash;three centuries
  ago&mdash;when the Catholics, driven from their rich lowland farms, which
  were given to the Scottish Presbyterian planters, had to eke out a living
  among the glens and mountains.</p>

  <p>When a person does anything out of the common&mdash;which is not
  expected of him&mdash;especially anything with a look of unusual
  prosperity:&mdash;'It is not every day that Manus kills a bullock.'
  (Derry.) This saying, which is always understood to refer to Roman
  Catholics, is a memorial, in one flash, of the plantation of the northern
  districts. Manus is a common Christian name among the Catholics round
  Derry, who are nearly all very poor: how could they be otherwise? That
  Manus&mdash;i.e. a Catholic&mdash;should kill a bullock is consequently
  taken as a type of things very unusual, unexpected and exceptional.
  Maxwell, in 'Wild Sports of the West,' quotes this saying as he heard it
  in Mayo; but naturally enough the saying alone had reached the west
  without its background of history, which is not known there as it is in
  Derry. <!-- Page 170 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page170"></a>{170}</span></p>

  <p>Even in the everyday language of the people the memory of those
  Plantations is sometimes preserved, as in the following sayings and their
  like, which are often heard. 'The very day after Jack Ryan was evicted,
  he <i>planted himself</i> on the bit of land between his farm and the
  river.' 'Bill came and <i>planted</i> himself on my chair, right in front
  of the fire.'</p>

  <p>'He that calls the tune should pay the piper' is a saying that
  commemorates one of our dancing customs. A couple are up for a dance: the
  young man asks the girl in a low voice what tune she'd like, and on
  hearing her reply he calls to the piper (or fiddler) for the tune. When
  the dance is ended and they have made their bow, he slips a coin into her
  hand, which she brings over and places in the hand of the piper. That was
  the invariable formula in Munster sixty years ago.</p>

  <p>The old Irish name of May-day&mdash;the 1st May&mdash;was
  <i>Belltaine</i> or <i>Beltene</i> [Beltina], and this name is still used
  by those speaking Irish; while in Scotland and Ulster they retain it as a
  common English word&mdash;Beltane:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Ours is no sapling, chance sown by the fountain,</p>
      <p>Blooming at Beltane, in winter to fade.'</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>('Lady of the Lake.')</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Before St. Patrick's time there was a great pagan festival in Ireland
  on 1st May in honour of the god <i>Bél</i> [Bail], in which fire played a
  prominent part: a custom evidently derived in some way from the
  Ph&oelig;nician fire festival in honour of the Ph&oelig;nician god
  <i>Baal</i>. For we know that the Ph&oelig;nicians were well acquainted
  with Ireland, and that wherever they went they introduced the worship of
  Baal with his festivals. <!-- Page 171 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page171"></a>{171}</span></p>

  <p>Among other usages the Irish drove cattle through or between big fires
  to preserve them from the diseases of the year; and this custom was
  practised in Limerick and Clare down a period within my own memory: I saw
  it done. But it was necessary that the fires should be kindled from
  <i>tenaigin</i> [<i>g</i> sounded as in <i>pagan</i>]&mdash;'forced
  fire'&mdash;i.e., fire produced by the friction of two pieces of dry wood
  rubbed together till they burst into a flame: Irish <i>teine-éigin</i>
  from <i>tein&#x115;</i>, fire, and <i>éigean</i>, force. This word is
  still known in the South; so that the memory of the old pagan May-day
  festival and its fire customs is preserved in these two words
  <i>Beltane</i> and <i>tenaigin</i>.</p>

  <p>Mummers were companies of itinerant play-actors, who acted at popular
  gatherings, such as fairs, <i>patterns</i>, weddings, wakes, &amp;c.
  Formerly they were all masked, and then young <i>squireens</i>, and the
  young sons of strong farmers, often joined them for the mere fun of the
  thing; but in later times masking became illegal, after which the breed
  greatly degenerated. On the whole they were not unwelcome to the people,
  as they were generally the source of much amusement; but their antics at
  weddings and wakes were sometimes very objectionable, as well as very
  offensive to the families. This was especially the case at wakes, if the
  dead person had been unpopular or ridiculous, and at weddings if an old
  woman married a boy, or a girl an old man for the sake of his money.
  Sometimes they came bent on mischievous tricks as well as on a
  <i>shindy</i>; and if wind of this got out, the faction of the family
  gathered to protect them; and then there was sure to be a fight.
  (Kinahan.) <!-- Page 172 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page172"></a>{172}</span></p>

  <p>Mummers were well known in England, from which the custom was
  evidently imported to Ireland. The mummers are all gone, but the name
  remains.</p>

  <p>We know that in former times in Ireland the professions ran in
  families; so that members of the same household devoted themselves to one
  particular Science or Art&mdash;Poetry, History, Medicine, Building, Law,
  as the case might be&mdash;for generations (of this custom a full account
  may be seen in my 'Smaller Social History of Ancient Ireland,' chap.
  vii., especially page 184). A curious example of how the memory of this
  is preserved occurs in Armagh. There is a little worm called <i>dirab</i>
  found in bog-water. If this be swallowed by any accident it causes a
  swelling, which can be cured only by a person of the name of Cassidy, who
  puts his arms round the patient, and the worm dies. The O'Cassidys were
  hereditary physicians to the Maguires, chiefs of Fermanagh. Several
  eminent physicians of the name are commemorated in the Irish Annals: and
  it is interesting to find that they are still remembered in
  tradition&mdash;though quite unconsciously&mdash;for their skill in
  leechcraft.</p>

  <p>'I'll make you dance Jack Lattin'&mdash;a threat of chastisement,
  often heard in Kildare. John Lattin of Morristown House county Kildare
  (near Naas) wagered that he'd dance home to Morristown from
  Dublin&mdash;more than twenty miles&mdash;changing his dancing-steps
  every furlong: and won the wager. 'I'll make you dance' is a common
  threat heard everywhere: but 'I'll make you dance Jack Lattin' is ten
  times worse&mdash;'I'll make you dance excessively.' <!-- Page 173
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173"></a>{173}</span></p>

  <p>Morristown, Jack Lattin's residence, is near Lyons the seat of Lord
  Cloncurry, where Jack was often a guest, in the first half of the last
  century. Lady Morgan has an entry in her Memoirs (1830):&mdash;'Returned
  from Lyons&mdash;Lord Cloncurry's, a large party&mdash;the first day
  good&mdash;Sheil, Curran, Jack Lattin.'</p>

  <p>It is worthy of remark that there is a well-known Irish tune called
  'Jack Lattin,' which some of our Scotch friends have quietly
  appropriated; and not only that, but have turned Jack himself into a
  Scotchman by calling the tune 'Jockey Latin'! They have done precisely
  the same with our 'Eileen Aroon' which they call 'Robin Adair.' The same
  Robin Adair&mdash;or to call him by his proper name Robert
  Adair&mdash;was a well-known county Wicklow man and a member of the Irish
  Parliament.</p>

  <p>The word <i>sculloge</i> or <i>scolloge</i> is applied to a small
  farmer, especially one that does his own farm work: it is often used in a
  somewhat depreciatory sense to denote a mere rustic: and in both senses
  it is well known all over the South. This word has a long history. It was
  originally applied&mdash;a thousand years ago or more&mdash;to the
  younger monks of a monastery, who did most of the farm work on the land
  belonging to the religious community. These young men were of course
  students indoors, as well as tillers outside, and hence the name, from
  <i>scol</i>, a school:&mdash;<i>scológ</i> a young scholar. But as farm
  work constituted a large part of their employment the name gradually came
  to mean a working farmer; and in this sense it has come down to our
  time.</p>

  <p>To a rich man whose forefathers made their <!-- Page 174 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page174"></a>{174}</span>money by smuggling
  <i>pottheen</i> (illicit whiskey) from Innishowen in Donegal (formerly
  celebrated for its pottheen manufacture), they say in Derry 'your granny
  was a Dogherty who wore a tin pocket.' (Doherty a prevalent name in the
  neighbourhood.) For this was a favourite way of smuggling from the
  highlands&mdash;bringing the stuff in a tin pocket. Tom Boyle had a more
  ambitious plan:&mdash;he got a tinker to make a hollow figure of tin,
  something like the figure of his wife, who was a little woman, which Tom
  dressed up in his wife's clothes and placed on the pillion behind him on
  the horse&mdash;filled with pottheen: for in those times it was a common
  custom for the wife to ride behind her husband. At last a sharp-eyed
  policeman, seeing the man's affectionate attention so often repeated,
  kept on the watch, and satisfied himself at last that Tom had a tin wife.
  So one day, coming behind the animal he gave the poor little woman a
  whack of a stick which brought forth, not a screech, but a hard metallic
  sound, to the astonishment of everybody: and then it was all up with poor
  Tom and his wife.</p>

  <p>There are current in Ireland many stories of gaugers and pottheen
  distillers which hardly belong to my subject, except this one, which I
  may claim, because it has <i>left its name on</i> a well-known Irish
  tune:&mdash;'Paddy outwitted the gauger,' also called by three other
  names, 'The Irishman's heart for the ladies,' 'Drops of brandy,' and
  <i>Cummilum</i> (Moore's: 'Fairest put on Awhile'). Paddy Fogarty kept a
  little public-house at the cross-roads in which he sold 'parliament,'
  i.e. legal whiskey on which the duty had been paid; but it was well known
  that friends could get a little drop <!-- Page 175 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page175"></a>{175}</span>of pottheen too, on the
  sly. One hot July day he was returning home from Thurles with a
  ten-gallon cag on his back, slung by a strong <i>soogaun</i> (hay rope).
  He had still two good miles before him, and he sat down to rest, when who
  should walk up but the new gauger. 'Well my good fellow, what have you
  got in that cask?' Paddy dropped his jaw, looking the picture of terror,
  and mumbled out some tomfoolery like an excuse. 'Ah, my man, you needn't
  think of coming over me: I see how it is: I seize this cask in the name
  of the king.' Poor Paddy begged and prayed, and talked about Biddy and
  the childher at home&mdash;all to no use: the gauger slung up the cag on
  his back (about a hundredweight) and walked on, with Paddy, heart-broken,
  walking behind&mdash;for the gauger's road lay towards Paddy's house. At
  last when they were near the cross-roads the gauger sat down to rest, and
  laying down the big load began to wipe his face with his handkerchief.
  'Sorry I am,' says Paddy, 'to see your honour so dead <i>bet</i> up: sure
  you're sweating like a bull: maybe I could relieve you.' And with that he
  pulled his legal <i>permit</i> out of his pocket and laid it on the cag.
  The gauger was astounded: 'Why the d&mdash;&mdash; didn't you show me
  that before?' 'Why then 'tis the way your honour,' says Paddy, looking as
  innocent as a lamb, 'I didn't like to make so bould as I wasn't axed to
  show it?' So the gauger, after a volley of something that needn't be
  particularised here, walked off <i>with himself without an inch of the
  tail</i>. 'Faix,' says Paddy, ''tis easy to know 'twasn't our last
  gauger, ould Warnock, that was here: 'twouldn't be so easy to come round

  <p>In Sligo if a person is sick in a house, and one of the cattle dies,
  they say 'a life for a life,' and the patient will recover. Mr. Kinahan
  says, 'This is so universal in the wilds of Sligo that Protestants and
  Catholics believe it alike.'</p>

  <p>As an expression of welcome, a person says, 'We'll spread green rushes
  under your feet'; a memory of the time when there were neither boards nor
  carpets on the floors&mdash;nothing but the naked clay&mdash;in Ireland
  as well as in England; and in both countries, it was the custom to strew
  the floors of the better class of houses with rushes, which were renewed
  for any distinguished visitor. This was always done by the
  women-servants: and the custom was so general and so well understood that
  there was a knife of special shape for cutting the rushes. (See my
  'Smaller Social Hist. of Ancient Ireland,' p. 305.)</p>

  <p>A common exclamation of drivers for urging on a horse, heard
  everywhere in Ireland, is <i>hupp, hupp!</i> It has found its way even
  into our nursery rhymes; as when a mother is dancing her baby up and down
  on her knee, she sings:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'How many miles to Dub-l-in?</p>
      <p class="i2">Three score and ten,</p>
      <p>Will we be there by candle light?</p>
      <p class="i2">Yes and back again:</p>
      <p><i>Hupp, hupp</i> my little horse,</p>
      <p class="i2"><i>Hupp, hupp</i> again.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This Irish word, insignificant as it seems, has come down from a
  period thirteen or fourteen hundred years ago, or probably much farther
  back. In the library of St. Gall in Switzerland there is a manuscript
  written in the eighth century by some scholarly Irish <!-- Page 177
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page177"></a>{177}</span>monk&mdash;who
  he was we cannot tell: and in this the old writer <i>glosses</i> or
  explains many Latin words by corresponding Irish words. Among others the
  Latin interjection <i>ei</i> or <i>hei</i> (meaning ho! quick! come on)
  is explained by <i>upp</i> or <i>hupp</i> (Zeuss).</p>

  <p>Before Christianity had widely spread in Ireland, the pagans had a
  numerous pantheon of gods and goddesses, one of which was <i>Badb</i>
  [bibe], a terrible war-fury. Her name is pronounced <i>Bibe</i> or
  <i>Bybe</i>, and in this form it is still preserved all over Cork and
  round about, not indeed for a war-fury, but for what&mdash;in the opinion
  of some people&mdash;is nearly as bad, a <i>scolding woman</i>. (For
  <i>Badb</i> and all the other pagan Irish gods and goddesses, see my
  'Smaller Social History of Ancient Ireland,' chap. v.)</p>

  <p>From the earliest times in Ireland animals were classified with regard
  to grazing; and the classification is recognised and fully laid down in
  the Brehon Law. The legal classification was this:&mdash;two geese are
  equivalent to a sheep; two sheep to a <i>dairt</i> or one-year-old
  heifer; two <i>dairts</i> to one <i>colpach</i> or <i>collop</i> (as it
  is now called) or two-year-old heifer; two <i>collops</i> to one cow.
  Suppose a man had a right to graze a certain number of cows on a common
  (i.e. pasture land not belonging to individuals but common to all the
  people of the place collectively); he might turn out the exact number of
  cows or the equivalent of any other animals he pleased, so long as the
  total did not exceed the total amount of his privilege.</p>

  <p>In many parts of Ireland this system almost exactly as described above
  is kept up to this day, the collop being taken as the unit: it was
  universal in my native place sixty years ago; and in a way it exists <!--
  Page 178 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>{178}</span>there
  still. The custom is recognised in the present-day land courts, with some
  modifications in the classification&mdash;as Mr. Maurice Healy informs me
  in an interesting and valuable communication&mdash;the <i>collop</i>
  being still the unit&mdash;and constantly referred to by the lawyers in
  the conduct of cases. So the old Brehon Law process has existed
  continuously from old times, and is repeated by the lawyers of our own
  day; and its memory is preserved in the word <i>collop</i>. (See my
  'Smaller Soc. Hist. of Anc. Ireland,' p. 431.)</p>

  <p>In pagan times the religion of Ireland was Druidism, which was taught
  by the druids: and far off as the time is the name of these druids still
  exists in our popular speech. The Irish name for a druid is <i>drui</i>
  [dree]; and in the South any crabbed cunning old-fashioned-looking little
  boy is called&mdash;even by speakers of English&mdash;a <i>shoundree</i>,
  which exactly represents in sound the Irish <i>sean-drui</i>, old druid;
  from <i>sean</i> [shoun or shan], old. (See 'Irish Names of Places,' I.
  98.)</p>

  <p>There are two words much in use in Munster, of which the phonetic
  representations are <i>thoothach</i> or <i>thoohagh</i> and <i>hóchan</i>
  (<i>ó</i> long), which tell a tale of remote times. A <i>thoothach</i> or
  <i>thoohagh</i> is an ignorant unmannerly clownish fellow: and
  <i>hóchan</i> means much the same thing, except that it is rather lower
  in the sense of ignorance or uncouthness. Passing through the Liberties
  of Dublin I once heard a woman&mdash;evidently from Limerick&mdash;call a
  man a dirty <i>hóchan</i>. Both words are derived from <i>tuath</i>
  [thooa], a layman, as distinguished from a cleric or a man of learning.
  The Irish form of the first is <i>tuathtach</i>: of the second
  <i>thuathcháin</i> (vocative). Both are a memory of the <!-- Page 179
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179"></a>{179}</span>time when
  illiterate people were looked down upon as boorish and ill-mannered as
  compared with clerics or with men of learning in general.</p>

  <p>The people had great respect and veneration for the old families of
  landed gentry&mdash;the <i>real old stock</i> as they were called. If a
  man of a lower class became rich so as to vie with or exceed in
  possessions many of the old families, he was never recognised as on their
  level or as a gentleman. Such a man was called by the people a
  <i>half-sir</i>, which bears its meaning on its face.</p>

  <p>Sixty years ago people very generally used home-made and home-grown
  produce&mdash;frieze&mdash;linen&mdash;butter&mdash;bacon&mdash;potatoes
  and vegetables in general. A good custom, for 'a cow never burst herself
  by chewing her cud.' (MacCall: Wexford.)</p>

  <p>To see one magpie or more is a sign of bad or good luck,
  viz.:&mdash;'One for sorrow; two for mirth; three for a wedding; four for
  a birth.' (MacCall: Wexford.)</p>

  <p>The war-cry of the great family of O'Neill of Tyrone was
  <i>Lauv-derg-aboo</i> (the Red Hand to Victory: the Red Hand being the
  cognisance of the O'Neills): and this cry the clansmen shouted when
  advancing to battle. It is many a generation since this same cry was
  heard in battle; and yet it is remembered in popular sayings to this day.
  In Tyrone when a fight is expected one man will say to another 'there
  will be <i>Dergaboos</i> to-day': not that the cry will be actually
  raised; but <i>Dergaboo</i> has come to be a sort of symbolic name for a
  fight.</p>

  <p>In and around Ballina in Mayo, a great strong fellow is called an
  <i>allay-foozee</i>, which represents the <!-- Page 180 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page180"></a>{180}</span>sound of the French
  <i>Allez-fusil</i> (musket or musketry forward), preserving the memory of
  the landing of the French at Killala (near Ballina) in 1798.</p>

  <p>When a person looks as if he were likely to die soon:&mdash;'He's in
  the raven's book.' Because when a person is about to die, the raven
  croaks over the house. (MacCall: Wexford.)</p>

  <p>A 'cross' was a small old Irish coin so called from a figure of St.
  Patrick stamped on it with a conspicuous cross. Hence a person who has no
  money says 'I haven't a cross.' In Wexford they have the same saying with
  a little touch of drollery added on:&mdash;'There isn't as much as a
  cross in my pocket to keep the devil from dancing in it.' (MacCall.) For
  of course the devil dare not come near a cross of any shape or form.</p>

  <p>A <i>keenoge</i> (which exactly represents the pronunciation of the
  Irish <i>cíanóg</i>) is a very small coin, a farthing or half a farthing.
  It was originally applied to a small foreign coin, probably Spanish, for
  the Irish <i>cían</i> is 'far off,' 'foreign': <i>óg</i> is the
  diminutive termination. It is often used like 'cross': 'I haven't as much
  as a keenoge in my pocket.' 'Are you not going to lend me any money at
  all?' 'Not a keenoge.'</p>

  <p>A person not succeeding in approaching the house or spot he wants to
  reach; hitting wide of the mark in shooting; not coming to the point in
  argument or explanation:&mdash;'Oh you didn't come within the bray of an
  ass of it.' This is the echo of a very old custom. More than a thousand
  years ago distance was often vaguely measured in Ireland by sound. A man
  felling a tree was 'bound by the Brehon Law <!-- Page 181 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>{181}</span>to give warning as far
  as his voice could reach,' so as to obviate danger to cattle or people.
  We find a like measure used in Donegal to this day:&mdash;[The Dublin
  house where you'll get the book to buy is on the Quays] 'about a mountain
  man's call below the Four Courts.' (Seumas MacManus.) The crow of a cock
  and the sound of a bell (i.e. the small hand-bell then used) as measures
  of distances are very often met with in ancient Irish writings. An old
  commentator on the Brehon Laws defines a certain distance to be 'as far
  as the sound of the bell or the crow of a barn-door cock could be heard.
  This custom also prevailed among other ancient nations. (See my 'Smaller
  Soc. Hist. of Anc. Ireland,' p. 473.)</p>

  <p><i>The 'Duty'.</i> Formerly all through Ireland the tenants were
  obliged to work for their landlords on a certain number of days free,
  except that they generally got food. Such work was commonly called in
  English the 'duty.' In Wicklow for example&mdash;until very
  recently&mdash;or possibly still&mdash;those who had horses had to draw
  home the landlord's turf on certain days. In Wexford they had in a
  similar way to draw stones for the embankments on the Barrow. The tenants
  commonly collected in numbers on the same day and worked all together.
  The Irish word used to designate such gatherings was
  <i>bal</i>&mdash;still so called in Connaught. It was usual to hear such
  English expressions as&mdash;'Are you going to the duty?' or 'Are you
  going to the bal?' (Kinahan.)</p>

  <p>(N.B. I do not know the Irish word <i>bal</i> in this sense, and
  cannot find it in the Dictionaries.)</p>

  <p>'Duty' is used in a religious sense by Roman <!-- Page 182 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page182"></a>{182}</span>Catholics all through
  Ireland to designate the obligation on all Catholics to go to Confession
  and Holy Communion at Easter time. 'I am going to my duty, please God,
  next week.'</p>

  <p>'I'll return you this book on next Saturday <i>as sure as the
  hearth-money</i>': a very common expression in Ireland. The old English
  oppressive impost called <i>hearth-money</i>&mdash;a tax on
  hearths&mdash;which every householder had to pay, was imported into
  Ireland by the English settlers. Like all other taxes it was certain to
  be called for and gathered at the proper time, so that our saying is an
  apt one; but while the bad old impost is gone, its memory is preserved in
  the everyday language of the people.</p>

  <p>A king, whether of a small or large territory, had in his service a
  champion or chief fighting man whose duty it was to avenge all insults or
  offences offered to the families of the king and tribe, particularly
  murder; like the 'Avenger of blood' of the Jews and other ancient
  nations. In any expected danger from without he had to keep
  watch&mdash;with a sufficient force&mdash;at the most dangerous ford or
  pass&mdash;called <i>bearna baoghaill</i> [barna beel] or gap of
  danger&mdash;on that part of the border where invasion was expected, and
  prevent the entrance of any enemy. This custom, which is as old as our
  race in Ireland, is remembered in our present-day speech, whether Irish
  or Anglo-Irish; for the man who courageously and successfully defends any
  cause or any position, either by actual fighting or by speeches or
  written articles, is 'the man in the gap.' Of the old Irish chiefs Thomas
  Davis writes:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Their hearts were as soft as the child in the lap,</p>
      <p>Yet they were the men in the gap.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 183 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183"></a>{183}</span></p>

  <p>In the old heroic semi-historic times in Ireland, a champion often
  gave a challenge by standing in front of the hostile camp or fort and
  striking a few resounding blows with the handle of his spear either on
  his own shield or on a shield hung up for the purpose at the entrance
  gate outside.<a name="NtA7" href="#Nt7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The memory of this very old custom lives in a word still very common
  in the South of Ireland&mdash;<i>boolimskee</i>, Irish
  <i>buailim-sciath</i>, 'I strike the shield,' applied to a man much given
  to fighting, a quarrelsome fellow, a swaggering bully&mdash;a
  swash-buckler.</p>

  <p>Paying on the nail, paying down on the nail; paying on the
  spot&mdash;ready cash. This expression had its origin in a custom
  formerly prevailing in Limerick city. In a broad thoroughfare under the
  Exchange stood a pillar about four feet high, on the top of which was a
  circular plate of copper about three feet in diameter. This pillar was
  called 'The Nail.' The purchaser of anything laid down the stipulated
  price or the earnest <i>on the nail</i>, i.e. on the brass plate, which
  the seller took up: when this was done before witnesses the transaction
  was as binding as if entered on parchment. (O'Keeffe's Recollections.)
  'The Nail' is still to the fore, and may now be seen in the Museum of the
  Carnegie Library building, to which it was transferred a short time
  ago.</p>

  <p>The change in the Calendar from the old style to the new style, a
  century and a half ago, is noted in the names for Christmas. All through
  the South, <!-- Page 184 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page184"></a>{184}</span>and in other parts of Ireland, the 6th
  January ('Twelfth Day') is called 'Old Christmas' and 'Little Christmas'
  (for before the change of style it was <i>the</i> Christmas): and in many
  parts of the north our present Christmas is called New Christmas. So in
  Donegal the 12th of May is called by the people 'Old May day.' (Seumas
  MacManus.)</p>

  <p><i>Palm, Palm-Sunday.</i> The usual name in Ireland for the yew-tree
  is 'palm,' from the custom of using yew branches instead of the real
  palm, to celebrate Palm Sunday&mdash;the Sunday before
  Easter&mdash;commemorating the palm branches that were strewed before our
  Lord on His public entry into Jerusalem. I was quite a grown boy before I
  knew the yew-tree by its proper name&mdash;it was always
  <i>palm-tree</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Oliver's Summons.</i>&mdash;When a lazy fellow was driven to work
  either by hunger or by any unavoidable circumstance he was said to have
  got <i>Oliver's Summons</i>, a common household word in parts of the
  county Limerick in my younger days, originating in the following
  circumstance. When a good plentiful harvest came round, many of the men
  of our neighbourhood at this time&mdash;about the beginning of last
  century&mdash;the good old easy-going times&mdash;worked very
  little&mdash;as little as ever they could. What was the use of working
  when they had plenty of beautiful floury potatoes for half nothing, with
  salt or <i>dip</i>, or perhaps a piggin of fine thick milk to crown the
  luxury. Captain Oliver, the local landlord, and absolute monarch so far
  as ordinary life was concerned, often&mdash;in those seasons&mdash;found
  it hard or impossible to get men to come to do the necessary work about
  his grounds&mdash;though paying <!-- Page 185 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page185"></a>{185}</span>the usual wages&mdash;till at last he hit
  on an original plan. He sent round, the evening before, to the houses of
  the men he wanted, a couple of fellows with a horse and cart, who seized
  some necessary article in each house&mdash;a spinning-wheel, a bed, the
  pot, the single table, &amp;c.&mdash;and brought them all away body and
  bones, and kept them impounded. Next morning he was sure to have half a
  dozen or more strapping fellows, who fell to work; and when it was
  finished and wages paid, the captain sent home the articles. I had this
  story from old men who saw the carts going round with their loads.</p>

<p class="cenhead">A VARIETY OF PHRASES.</p>

  <p>Among fireside amusements propounding riddles was very general sixty
  or seventy years ago. This is a custom that has existed in Ireland from
  very early times, as the reader may see by looking at my 'Old Celtic
  Romances,' pp. 69, 186, 187, where he will find some characteristic
  ancient Irish ones. And we know that it was common among other ancient
  nations. I have a number of our modern Irish riddles, many in my memory,
  and some supplied to me from Wexford by Mr. Patrick J. MacCall of Dublin,
  who knows Wexford well. Some are easy enough: but there are others that
  might defy the Witch of Endor to answer them. They hardly come within my
  scope, but I will give a few examples. <!-- Page 186 --><span

  the following. Samson's riddle about the bees is hard enough, but ours
  beats it hollow. Though Solomon solved all the puzzles propounded to him
  by the Queen of Sheba, I think this would put him to the pin of his

  Wexford version from Mr. MacCall. Observe the delightful inconsequence of

  <p>Answer: the fox burying his mother under a holly tree.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>To a person who begins his dinner without saying grace: 'You begin
  your meal like a fox': for a fox never says grace. A fox once ran off
  with a cock&mdash;neck in mouth&mdash;to make a meal of him. Just as he
  was about to fall to, the cock said&mdash;'Won't you thank God?' So the
  fox opened his mouth to say grace, and the cock escaped and flew up into
  a tree. On which the fox swore he'd never more say grace or any other
  prayer. (From Clare: Healy.)</p>

  <p>In depreciation of a person's honour: 'Your honour and goat's wool

  <p>Of a pair of well-matched bad men:&mdash;'They might lick thumbs.'
  Also 'A pity to spoil two houses with them.' (Moran: Carlow.)</p>

  <p>A person is said to be 'belled through the parish' when some
  discreditable report concerning him has gone about in the neighbourhood.
  The allusion is to a bellman announcing something to the public. (Moran:
  Carlow.) <!-- Page 188 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>A person addresses some abusive and offensive words to another, who

  <p>The Chairman of the Banbridge Board of Guardians <!-- Page 190
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190"></a>{190}</span>lately asked a
  tramp what was his occupation: to which the fellow&mdash;cancelling his
  impudence by his drollery&mdash;replied:&mdash;'I'm a hailstone maker out
  of work owing to the want of snow.'</p>

  <p>My partner in any business has acted against my advice and has
  persisted, notwithstanding my repeated friendly remonstrances, till at
  last he brings failure and discredit. Yet when the trial comes I <i>stand
  black for him</i>; i.e. I act loyally towards him&mdash;I defend him: I
  take my share of the blame, and never give the least hint that the
  failure is all his doing. <i>Standing black</i> often heard.</p>

  <p>'He's not all there,' i.e. he is a little daft, a little
  <i>cracked</i>, weak-minded, foolish, has a slight touch of insanity:
  'there's a slate off,' 'he has a bee in his bonnet' (Scotch): 'he wants a
  square' (this last Old English).</p>

  <p>A man gets into an angry fit and you take no trouble to pacify
  him:&mdash;'Let him cool in the skin he heated in.' (Moran: Carlow.)</p>

  <p>A person asks me for money: I give him all I have, which is less than
  he asked for:&mdash;'That is all [the corn] there's threshed.' (Moran:
  Carlow.)</p>

  <p>A man with a very thin face 'could kiss a goat between the horns.'
  (Moran: Carlow.)</p>

  <p>'Never put a tooth on it': an invitation to speak out plainly,
  whatever the consequences.</p>

  <p>A woman giving evidence at Drumcondra Petty Sessions last year says 'I
  was born and reared in Finglas, and there isn't one&mdash;man or
  woman&mdash;that dare say <i>black was the white of my eye</i>': that is,
  no one could allege any wrong-doing against her. Heard everywhere in
  Ireland. <!-- Page 191 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>A man who is going backwards or down the hill in circumstances is said
  to be 'going after his back.' The sense is obvious. (Moran: Wexford.)</p>

  <p>'Come day go day God send Sunday,' applied to an easy-going idle
  good-for-nothing person, who never looks to the future.</p>

  <p>When a person is asked about something of which for some reason he
  does not wish to speak, he says 'Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no
  lies.' (General.)</p>

  <p>A man who is of opinion that his friend has bought a cow too dear says
  'You bought every hair in her tail.'</p>

  <p>To a person everlastingly talking:&mdash;'Give your tongue a

  <p>He always visits us <i>of a Saturday</i>. Halliwell says this is

  <p>When flinging an abusive epithet at a person, 'you' is often put in
  twice, first as an opening tip, and last as a finishing home
  blow:&mdash;'What else could I expect from your like, <i>you unnatural

  <p>Small trifling things are expressed by a variety of

  <p>To be rid of a person or thing is expressed by 'I got shut of him,' or
  'I am done of it.' (Limerick.)</p>

  <p>'How did you travel to town?' 'Oh I went <i>on shanks' mare</i>:' i.e.

  <p>Banagher is a village in King's Co. on the Shannon: Ballinasloe is a
  town in Galway at the other side of the river. When anything very unusual
  or unexpected occurs, the people say,'Well that bangs Banagher!' or 'that
  bangs Banagher and Ballinasloe!'</p>

  <p>'Have you got a shilling to spare for a friend?' 'Indeed I have not.'
  'Ah you must give it to me; it <!-- Page 193 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  horse of another colour</i>.' (So he gives it.)</p>

  <p>'<i>Well done mother!</i>' says the blacksmith when the tooth was out.
  This is how it was pulled. He tied one end of a strong string round the
  tooth, and the other end to the horn of the anvil, and made the old woman
  keep back her head so as to tighten the string. '<i>Asy</i> now mother,'
  says he. Then taking the flaming horseshoe from the fire with the tongs
  he suddenly thrust it towards her face. Anyone can finish the story.</p>

  <p>If she catches you she'll <i>comb your hair with the creepy stool</i>:
  i.e. she'll whack and beat you with it. (Ulster.)</p>

  <p>They say pigs can see the wind, and that it is red. In very old times
  the Irish believed that there were twelve different winds with twelve
  colours. (For these see my 'Smaller Soc. Hist. of Anc. Ireland,' p. 527.)
  The people also will tell you that a pig will swim till the water cuts
  its throat.</p>

  <p>Ah, I see you want <i>to walk up my sleeve</i>: i.e. you want to
  deceive me&mdash;<i>to take me in</i>. (Kerry.)</p>

  <p>An expression often heard in the South:&mdash;Such and such a thing
  will happen now and then <i>if you were to put your eyes on sticks</i>;
  i.e. however watchful you may be. 'Well, if I was to put my eyes upon
  sticks, Misther Mann, I never would know your sister again.' (Gerald
  Griffin.)</p>

  <p>He <i>is down in the mouth</i>, i.e. he is in low spirits. I suppose
  this is from the dropping down of the corners of the mouth.</p>

  <p>To scold a person&mdash;to reprimand him&mdash;to give him a good
  'setting down'&mdash;to give him 'all sorts'&mdash;to give him 'the rough
  side of your tongue.' <!-- Page 194 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>Anything that cheers you up 'takes the cockles off your heart': 'Here
  drink this [glass of punch, wine, &amp;c.] and 'twill take the cockles
  off your heart.' 'It raises the very cockles o' my heart to see you.'
  ('Collegians.') ''Twould rise the cockles av your heart to hear her
  singing the Coolin.' ('Knocknagow.') Probably the origin is
  this:&mdash;Cares and troubles clog the heart as cockles clog a ship.</p>

  <p>Instead of 'No blame to you' or 'Small blame to you,' the people often
  say, ''Tis a stepmother would blame you.'</p>

  <p>'Cut your stick, now,' 'cut away'; both mean <i>go away</i>: the idea
  being that you want a walking stick and that it is time for you to cut
  it.</p>

  <p>'I hear William is out of his situation.' 'Yes indeed, that is true.'
  'And how is he living?' 'I don't know; I suppose he's living <i>on the
  fat of his guts</i>': meaning he is living on whatever he has saved. But
  it is sometimes used in the direct sense. Poor old Hill, while his shop
  prospered, had an immense paunch, but he became poor and had to live on
  poor food and little of it, so that the belly got flat; and the people
  used to say&mdash;he's living now on the fat of his guts, poor old
  fellow.</p>

  <p>Tom Hogan is managing his farm in a way likely to bring him to
  poverty, and Phil Lahy says to him&mdash;'Tom, you'll scratch a
  beggarman's back yet': meaning that Tom will himself be the beggarman.
  ('Knocknagow.') Common all over Munster.</p>

  <p>The people have a gentle laudable habit of mixing up sacred names and
  pious phrases with their ordinary conversation, in a purely reverential
  spirit. This is one of the many peculiarities of Anglo-Irish <!-- Page
  195 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195"></a>{195}</span>speech
  derived from the Irish language: for pious expressions pervaded Irish to
  its very heart, of which the people lost a large part when they ceased to
  speak the language. Yet it continues very prevalent among our
  English-speaking people; and nearly all the expressions they use are
  direct translations from Irish.</p>

  <p>'I hear there is a mad dog running about the town.' 'Oh do you tell me
  so&mdash;the Lord between us and harm!' or 'the Lord preserve us!' both
  very common exclamations in case of danger.</p>

  <p>Sudden news is brought about something serious happening to a
  neighbour, and the people say:&mdash;'Oh, God bless the hearers,' or 'God
  bless the mark.' This last is however generally used in derision. John
  Cox, a notorious schemer and miser, 'has put down his name for £20 for a
  charity&mdash;God bless the mark!' an intimation that the £20 will never
  be heard of again.</p>

  <p>When a person goes away for ever or dies, the friends and people say
  'God be with him,' a very beautiful expression, as it is the
  concentration of human affection and regret, and also a prayer. It is
  merely the translation of the Irish <i>Dia leis</i>, which has forms for
  all the three persons and two genders:&mdash;'with her,' 'with you, 'with
  them,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Under any discouraging or distressing circumstances, the expressions
  'God help me' and 'God help us' are continually in the mouths of the
  people. They are merely translations of <i>go bh-fóireadh Día
  orruinn</i>, &amp;c. Similarly, expressions of pity for another such as
  'That poor woman is in great trouble, God help her,' are translations.
  <!-- Page 196 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>In Dublin, Roman Catholics when passing a Catholic church (or
  'chapel') remove the hat or cap for a moment as a mark of respect, and
  usually utter a short aspiration or prayer under breath. This custom is I
  think spreading.</p>

  <p>When one expresses his intention to do anything even moderately
  important, he always adds 'please God.' Even in our English speech this
  is of old standing. During the Irish wars of Elizabeth, it was told to an
  Irish chief that one of the English captains had stated he would take
  such and such a castle, when the chief retorted, 'Oh yes, but did he say
  <i>please God</i>': as much as to say, 'yes if God pleases, but not
  otherwise.'</p>

  <p>'This sickness kept me from Mass for a long time; but <i>with the help
  of God</i>, I'll venture next Sunday.' 'Yes, poor Kitty is in great
  danger, but <i>with the help of God</i> she will pull through.'</p>

  <p>'I am afraid that poor Nellie will die after that accident.' 'Oh, God
  forbid,' is the response.</p>

  <p>People have a pleasing habit of applying the word <i>blessèd</i>
  [2-syll.] to many natural objects, to days, nights, &amp;c. 'Well, you
  have teased me terribly the whole of this blessèd day&mdash;you young
  vagabone.'</p>

  <p>A man is on the verge of ruin, or in some other great trouble, and the
  neighbours will say, 'the Lord will open a gap for him': meaning God will
  find some means of extricating him. Father Higgins, who sent me this,
  truly remarks:&mdash;'This is a fine expressive phrase showing the
  poetical temperament of our people, and their religious spirit too.'</p>

  <p>When anything happens very much out of the common:&mdash;'Glory be to
  God, isn't that wonderful.'</p>

  <p>At the mention of the name of a person that is dead, the Roman
  Catholic people invariably utter the little prayer 'God rest his soul' or
  'the Lord have mercy on him.'</p>

  <p>The people thank God for everything, whatever it may be His will to
  send, good or bad. 'Isn't this a beautiful day, Mike.' ''Tis indeed,
  thank God.' 'This is a terrible wet day, William, and very bad for the
  crops.' 'It is indeed Tom, thanks be to God for all: He knows best.'</p>

  <p>As might be expected where expressions of this kind are so constantly
  in the people's mouths, it happens occasionally that they come in rather
  awkwardly. Little Kitty, running in from the dairy with the eyes starting
  out of her head, says to her mother who is talking to a neighbour in the
  kitchen: 'Oh, mother, mother, I saw a terrible thing in the cream.' 'Ah,
  never mind, child,' says the mother, suspecting the truth and anxious to
  hush it up, 'it's nothing but the grace of God.' 'Oh but mother, sure the
  grace of God hasn't a long tail.'</p>

  <p>The following story was current when I was a <!-- Page 198 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page198"></a>{198}</span>child, long before
  Charles Kickham wrote 'Knocknagow,' in which he tells the story too: but
  I will give it in his words. A station is held at Maurice Kearney's,
  where the family and servants and the neighbours go to Confession and
  receive Holy Communion: among the rest Barney Broderick the stable boy.
  After all was over, Father MacMahon's driver provokes and insults Barney,
  who is kept back, and keeps himself back with difficulty from falling on
  him and 'knocking his two eyes into one' and afterwards 'breaking every
  tooth in his head.' 'Damn well the <i>blagard</i> knows,' exclaims
  Barney, 'that I'm in a state of grace to-day. But'&mdash;he continued,
  shaking his fist at the fellow&mdash;'but, please God I won't be in a
  state of grace always.'</p>

  <p>When a person is smooth-tongued, meek-looking, over civil, and
  deceitful, he is <i>plauzy</i> [plausible], 'as mild as ever on stirabout
  smiled.' 'Oh she is sly enough; she looks as if <i>butter wouldn't melt
  in her mouth</i>.' (Charles Macklin&mdash;an Irish writer&mdash;in <i>The
  Man of the World</i>.) This last expression of Macklin's is heard
  everywhere here.</p>

  <p>A person is in some sore fix, or there is trouble before him: 'I
  wouldn't like to be <i>in his shoes</i> just now.'</p>

  <p>A person falls in for some piece of good fortune:&mdash;'Oh you're
  <i>made up</i>, John: you're a <i>med</i> man; you're <i>on the pig's
  back</i> now.'</p>

  <p>In a house where the wife is master&mdash;the husband
  henpecked:&mdash;'the grey mare is the better horse.' (General.)</p>

  <p>He got the father of a beating; i.e. a great beating. <!-- Page 199
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199"></a>{199}</span></p>

  <p>'How did poor Jack get that mark on his face?' 'Oh he fell over his
  shadow': meaning he fell while he was drunk.</p>

  <p>A good dancer 'handles his feet well.' (MacCall: Wexford.)</p>

  <p>A pensioner, a loafer, or anyone that has nothing to do but walk
  about, is <i>an inspector of public buildings</i>.</p>

  <p>Those who leave Ireland commonly become all the more attached to it:
  they get to love <i>the old sod</i> all the more intensely. A poor old
  woman was dying in Liverpool, and Father O'Neill came and administered
  the last sacraments. He noticed that she still hesitated as if she wished
  to say something more; and after some encouragement she at length
  said:&mdash;'Well, father, I only wanted to ask you, <i>will my soul pass
  through Ireland on its journey?</i>' ('Knocknagow.') According to a
  religious legend in 'The Second Vision of Adamnan' the soul, on parting
  from the body, visits four places before setting out for its final
  destination:&mdash;the place of birth, the place of death, the place of
  baptism, and the place of burial. So this poor old woman got her
  wish.</p>

  <p>'Well, I don't like to say anything bad about you; and as for the
  other side, <i>the less I praise you the less I lie</i>.' (North.)</p>

  <p>There is a touch of heredity in this:&mdash;'You're nothing but a
  schemer like your seven generations before you.' (Kildare.)</p>

  <p>'Oh you need not be afraid: I'll call only very seldom henceforward.'
  Reply:&mdash;'The seldomer the welcomer.' <!-- Page 200 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page200"></a>{200}</span></p>

  <p>'Never dread the winter till the snow is on the blanket': i.e. as long
  as you have a roof over your head. An allusion to the misery of those
  poor people&mdash;numerous enough in the evil days of past
  times&mdash;who were evicted from house and home. (P. Reilly:
  Kildare.)</p>

  <p>Of a lucky man:&mdash;'That man's ducks are laying.'</p>

  <p>When a baby is born, the previous baby's 'nose is out of joint.' Said
  also of a young man who is supplanted by another in courtship.</p>

  <p>A man who supplants another in any pursuit or design is said to 'come
  inside him.'</p>

  <p>A person is speaking bitterly or uncharitably of one who is dead; and
  another says reprovingly&mdash;'let the dead rest.'</p>

  <p>When it is proposed to give a person something he doesn't need or
  something much too good for him, you oppose or refuse it by
  saying:&mdash;'<i>Cock him up with it</i>&mdash;how much he wants
  it!&mdash;I'll do no such thing.' Two gentlemen staying for a night in a
  small hotel in a remote country town ordered toast for breakfast, which
  it seems was very unusual there. They sat down to breakfast, but there
  was no sign of the toast. 'What about the toast?' asks one. Whereupon the
  impudent waiter replies&mdash;'Ah, then cock yez up with toast: how bad
  yez are for it.'</p>

  <p>A very general form of expression to point to a person's identity in a
  very vague way is seen in the following example:&mdash;'From whom did you
  buy that horse, James?' Reply:&mdash;'From <i>a man of the Burkes</i>
  living over there in Ballinvreena': i.e. a man named Burke. Mr. Seumas
  MacManus has adopted <!-- Page 201 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page201"></a>{201}</span>this idiom in the name of one of his
  books:&mdash;'A Lad of the O'Friels.'</p>

  <p>'I never saw the froth of your pot or the bead of your naggin': i.e.
  you have never entertained me. <i>Bead</i>, the string of little bubbles
  that rise when you shake whiskey in a bottle. (Kildare.)</p>

  <p>Of a man likely to die: 'he'll soon be a load for four': i.e. the four
  coffin-bearers. (Reilly: Kildare.)</p>

  <p>When a person attempts to correct you when you are not in
  error:&mdash;'Don't take me up till I fall.'</p>

  <p>When you make a good attempt:&mdash;'If I didn't knock it down, I
  staggered it.'</p>

  <p>'Love daddy, love mammy, love yourself best.' Said of a very selfish
  person.</p>

  <p>An odd expression:&mdash;'You are making such noise that <i>I can't
  hear my ears</i>.' (Derry; and also Limerick.)</p>

  <p>Plato to a young man who asked his advice about getting
  married:&mdash;'If you don't get married you'll be sorry: and if you do
  you'll be sorry.'</p>

  <p>Our Irish cynic is more bitter:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>The children were great pets with their grandmother: 'She wouldn't let
  anyone <i>look crooked</i> at them': i.e. she wouldn't permit the least
  unkindness.</p>

  <p>'Can he read a Latin book?' 'Read one! why, he can write Latin books,
  <i>let alone</i> reading them.' <i>Let alone</i> in this sense very
  common all over Ireland.</p>

  <p>A person offers to do you some kindness, and you accept it jokingly
  with 'Sweet is your hand in a pitcher of honey.' (Crofton Croker.) <!--

  <p>When a man falls into error, not very serious or criminal&mdash;gets
  drunk accidentally for instance&mdash;the people will say, by way of
  extenuation:&mdash;''Tis a good man's case.'</p>

  <p>You may be sure Tim will be at the fair to-morrow, <i>dead or alive or
  a-horseback</i>.</p>

  <p>'You never spoke but you said something': said to a person who makes a
  silly remark or gives foolish advice. (Kinahan).</p>

  <p>'He will never comb a grey hair': said of a young person who looks
  unhealthy and is likely to die early.</p>

  <p>Two persons had an angry dispute; and <i>one word borrowed another</i>
  till at last they came to blows. Heard everywhere in Ireland.</p>

  <p>The robin and the wren are God's cock and hen.</p>

  <p>'I'll take the book <i>and no thanks to you</i>,' i.e. I'll take it in
  spite of you, whether you like or no, against your will&mdash;'I'll take
  it in spite of your teeth'&mdash;'in spite of your nose': all very
  common.</p>

  <p>A person arrives barely in time for his purpose or to fulfil his
  engagement:&mdash;'You have just saved your distance.'</p>

  <p>To <i>put a person off the walk</i> means to kill him, to remove him
  in some way. (Meath.)</p>

  <p>A man has had a long fit of illness, and the wife, telling about it,
  says:&mdash;'For six weeks coal nor candle never went out.' (Antrim.)</p>

  <p>'To cure a person's hiccup' means to make him submit, to bring him to
  his senses, to make him acknowledge his error, by some decided course of
  action. A shopkeeper goes to a customer for payment of a debt, and gets
  no satisfaction, but, on the <!-- Page 203 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page203"></a>{203}</span>contrary, impudence. 'Oh well, I'll send
  you an attorney's letter to-morrow, and may be that will cure your
  hiccup.' The origin of this expression is the general belief through
  Ireland that a troublesome fit of hiccup may be cured by suddenly making
  some very startling and alarming announcement to the person&mdash;an
  announcement in which he is deeply concerned: such as that the stacks in
  the haggard are on fire&mdash;that three of his cows have just been
  drowned, &amp;c. Fiachra MacBrady, a schoolmaster and poet, of Stradone
  in Cavan (1712), wrote a humorous description of his travels through
  Ireland of which the translation has this verse:&mdash;</p>

  stick on which were marked in nicks all the drinks poor MacBrady had
  taken&mdash;a usual way of keeping accounts in old times. The sight of
  the <i>score</i> brought him to his senses at once&mdash;<i>cured his
  hiccup</i>.</p>

  <p>A verse of which the following is a type is very often found in our
  Anglo-Irish songs:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'The flowers in those valleys no more shall spring,</p>
      <p>The blackbirds and thrushes no more shall sing,</p>
      <p>The sea shall dry up and no water shall be,</p>
      <p>At the hour I'll prove false to sweet graw-mochree.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>So in Scotland:&mdash;'I will luve thee still, my dear, till a' the
  seas gang dry.' (Burns.)</p>

  <p>A warning sometimes given to a messenger:&mdash;'Now don't forget it
  like Billy and the pepper': This <!-- Page 204 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page204"></a>{204}</span>is the story of Billy
  and the pepper. A gander got killed accidentally; and as the family
  hardly ever tasted meat, there was to be a great treat that day. To top
  the grandeur they sent little Billy to town for a pennyworth of pepper.
  But Billy forgot the name, and only remembered that it was something hot;
  so he asked the shopman for a penn'orth of <i>hot-thing</i>. The man
  couldn't make head or tail of the <i>hot-thing</i>, so he questioned
  Billy. Is it mustard? No. Is it ginger? No. Is it pepper? Oh that's just
  it&mdash;<i>gandher's pepper</i>.</p>

  <p>A man has done me some intentional injury, and I say to him, using a
  very common phrase:&mdash;'Oh, well, wait; <i>I'll pay you off</i> for
  that': meaning 'I'll punish you for it&mdash;I'll have satisfaction.'</p>

  <p><i>Dry</i> for <i>thirsty</i> is an old English usage; for in
  Middleton's Plays it is found used in this sense. (Lowell.) It is almost
  universal in Ireland, where of course it survives from old English. There
  is an old Irish air and song called 'I think it no treason to drink when
  I'm <i>dry</i>': and in another old Folk Song we find this couplet:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'There was an old soldier riding by,</p>
      <p>He called for a quart because he was <i>dry</i>.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Instances of the odd perversion of sense by misplacing some little
  clause are common in all countries: and I will give here just one that
  came under my own observation. A young friend, a boy, had remained away
  an unusually long time without visiting us; and on being asked the reason
  he replied:&mdash;'I could not come, sir; I got a bite in the leg of
  dog'&mdash;an example which I think is unique. <!-- Page 205 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page205"></a>{205}</span></p>

  <p>On the first appearance of the new moon, a number of children linked
  hands and danced, keeping time to the following verse&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>I see the moon, the moon sees me,</p>
      <p>God bless the moon and God bless me:</p>
      <p>There's grace in the cottage and grace in the hall;</p>
      <p>And the grace of God is over us all.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>For the air to which this was sung see my 'Old Irish Folk Music and
  Songs,' p. 60.</p>

  <p>'Do you really mean to drive that horse of William's to pound?'
  'Certainly I will.' 'Oh very well; let ye take what you'll get.' Meaning
  you are likely to pay dear for it&mdash;you may take the consequences.
  (Ulster.)</p>

  <p>'If he tries to remove that stone without any help <i>it will take him
  all his time</i>': it will require his utmost exertions. (Ulster: very
  common.)</p>

  <p>When rain is badly wanted and often threatens but still doesn't come
  they say:&mdash;'It has great <i>hould</i> [hold] of the rain.' On the
  other hand when there is long continued wet weather:&mdash;'It is very
  fond of the rain.'</p>

  <p>When flakes of snow begin to fall:&mdash;'They are plucking the geese
  in Connaught.' 'Formerly in all the congested districts of Ireland [which
  are more common in Connaught than elsewhere] goose and duck feathers
  formed one of the largest industries.' (Kinahan.)</p>

  <p>Now James you should put down your name for more than 5<i>s.</i>:
  there's Tom Gallagher, not half so well off as you, <i>put the shame on
  you</i> by subscribing £1. (Kinahan: pretty general.) <!-- Page 206
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206"></a>{206}</span></p>

  <p>In stories 'a day' is often added on to a period of time, especially
  to a year. A person is banished out of Ireland for a year and a day.</p>

  <p>The battle of Ventry Harbour lasted for a year and a day, when at last
  the foreigners were defeated.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>There's a colleen fair as May,</p>
      <p>For a year and for a day</p>
      <p>I have sought by ev'ry way</p>
      <p class="i10">Her heart to gain.</p>

  <p>'Billy MacDaniel,' said the fairy, 'you shall be my servant for seven
  years and a day.' (Crofton Croker.) Borrowed from the Irish.</p>

  <p>The word <i>all</i> is often used by our rustic poets exactly as it is
  found in English folk-songs. Gay has happily imitated this popular usage
  in 'Black-eyed Susan':&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'All in the Downs the fleet was moored'&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and Scott in 'The Lay of the Last Minstrel':&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'All as they left the listed plain.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Any number of examples might be given from our peasant songs, but
  these two will be sufficient:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'As I roved out one evening two miles below Pomeroy</p>
      <p>I met a farmer's daughter <i>all on</i> the mountains high.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'How a young lady's heart was won</p>
      <p><i>All by</i> the loving of a farmer's son.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>(The two lovely airs of these will be found in two of my books: for
  the first, see 'The Mountains high' in 'Ancient Irish Music'; and for the
  second <!-- Page 207 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page207"></a>{207}</span>see 'Handsome Sally' in 'Old Irish Folk
  Music and Songs.')</p>

  <p>'He saw her on that day, and <i>never laid eyes on her</i> alive
  afterwards.' (Speech of Irish counsel in murder case: 1909.) A common
  expression.</p>

  <p>A wish for success either in life or in some particular
  undertaking&mdash;purely figurative of course:&mdash;'That the road may
  rise under you.' As the road continually rises under foot there is always
  an easy down hill in front. (Kerry.)</p>

  <p>Regarding some proposal or offer:&mdash;'I never said against it';
  i.e. I never disapproved of it&mdash;declined it&mdash;refused it.</p>

  <p>Be said by me: i.e. take my advice. (General.)</p>

  <p>When a cart-wheel screeches because the axle-tree has not been
  greased, it is <i>cursing for grease</i>. (Munster.)</p>

  <p>When a person wishes to keep out from another&mdash;to avoid argument
  or conflict, he says:&mdash;'The child's bargain&mdash;let me alone and
  I'll let you alone.'</p>

  <p>When a person goes to law expenses trying to recover a debt which it
  is very unlikely he will recover, that is 'throwing good money after
  bad.'</p>

  <p>'I'm the second tallest man in Mitchelstown'&mdash;or 'I'm the next
  tallest.' Both mean 'there is just one other man in Mitchelstown taller
  than me, and I come next to him.'</p>

  <p>'Your honour.' Old English: very common as a term of courtesy in the
  time of Elizabeth, and to be met with everywhere in the State papers and
  correspondence of that period. Used now all through Ireland by the
  peasantry when addressing persons very much above them. <!-- Page 208

  <p><i>The cabman's answer.</i> I am indebted to this cabman for giving me
  an opportunity of saying something here about myself. It is quite a
  common thing for people to write to me for information that they could
  easily find in my books: and this is especially the case in connexion
  with Irish place-names. I have always made it a point to reply to these
  communications. But of late they have become embarrassingly numerous,
  while my time is getting more circumscribed with every year of my long
  life. Now, this is to give notice to <i>all the world and Garrett
  Reilly</i> that henceforward I will give these good people the reply that
  the Dublin cabman gave the lady. 'Please, sir,' said she, 'will you
  kindly tell me the shortest way to St. Patrick's Cathedral.' He opened
  the door of his cab with his left hand, and pointing in with the
  forefinger of his right, answered&mdash;'In there ma'am.' <!-- Page 209

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">VOCABULARY AND INDEX.</p>

  <p>[In this Vocabulary, as well indeed as through the whole book,
  <i>gh</i> and <i>ch</i> are to be sounded guttural, as in <i>lough</i>
  and <i>loch</i>, unless otherwise stated or implied. Those who cannot
  sound the guttural may take the sound of <i>k</i> instead, and they will
  not be far wrong.]</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>(<span class="sc">Burns.</span>)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It is the Irish <i>áird</i>, a point of the compass.</p>

<p><!-- Page 210 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page210"></a>{210}</span></p>

  <p>Airy; ghostly, fearsome: an <i>airy</i> place, a haunted place. Same
  as Scotch <i>eerie</i>. From Gaelic <i>áedharaigh</i>, same sound and
  meaning. A survival of the old Irish pagan belief that air-demons were
  the most malignant of all supernatural beings: see Joyce's 'Old Celtic
  Romances,' p. 15.</p>

  <p>Alanna; my child: vocative case of Irish <i>leanbh</i> [lannav], a
  child.</p>

  <p>Allow; admit. 'I allow that you lent me a pound': 'if you allow that
  you cannot deny so and so.' This is an old English usage. (Ducange.) To
  advise or recommend: 'I would not allow you to go by that road' ('I would
  not recommend'). 'I'd allow you to sow that field with oats'
  (advise).</p>

  <p>All to; means except:&mdash;'I've sold my sheep all to six,' i.e.
  except six. This is merely a translation from the Irish as in <i>Do
  marbhadh na daoine uile go haon triúr</i>: 'The people were slain all to
  a single three.' (Keating.)</p>

  <p>Along of; on account of. Why did you keep me waiting [at night] so

  much afraid of the fairies.' (Crofton Croker.)</p>

  <p>Alpeen, a stick or hand-wattle with a knob at the lower end:
  diminutive of Irish <i>alp</i>, a knob. Sometimes called a

  <i>Clehalpeen</i>, a knobbed cudgel.</p>

  <p>Amadaun, a fool (man or boy), a half-fool, a foolish person. Irish

  see <i>Oanshagh</i>.</p>

  <p>American wake; a meeting of friends on the evening before the
  departure of some young people for <!-- Page 211 --><span

  <p>Ang-ishore; a poor miserable creature&mdash;man or woman. It is merely
  the Irish word <i>aindeiseóir</i>. (Chiefly South.)</p>

  <p>Any is used for <i>no</i> (in <i>no more</i>) in parts of West and
  North-west. 'James, you left the gate open this morning and the calves
  got out.' 'Oh I'm sorry sir; I will do it any more.' This is merely a
  mistranslation of <i>níos mo</i>, from some confused idea of the sense of
  two (Irish) negatives (<i>níos</i> being one, with another preceding)
  leading to the omission of an English negative from the correct
  construction&mdash;'I will <i>not</i> do it anymore:' <i>Níos mo</i>
  meaning in English 'no more' or 'any more' according to the omission or
  insertion of an English negative.</p>

  <p>Aree often used after <i>ochone</i> (alas) in Donegal and elsewhere.
  <i>Aree</i> gives the exact pronunciation of <i>a Righ</i>, and
  <i>neimhe</i> (heaven) is understood. The full Irish exclamation is
  <i>ochón a Righ neimhe</i>, 'alas, O King of heaven.'</p>

  <p>Arnaun or arnaul, to sit up working at night later than usual. Irish
  <i>airneán</i> or <i>airneál</i>, same meaning.</p>

  Irish <i>art</i> or <i>arc</i> is a lizard: <i>luachra</i>, rushes; the
  'lizard of the rushes.'</p>

  <p>Ask, a water-newt, a small water-lizard: from <i>esc</i> or
  <i>easc</i> [ask], an old Irish word for water. From the same root comes
  the next word, the diminutive form&mdash;</p>

  with him so far.</p>

  <p>Bacon: to 'save one's bacon'; to succeed in escaping some serious
  personal injury&mdash;death, a beating, &amp;c. 'They fled from the fight
  to save their bacon': 'Here a lodging I'd taken, but loth to awaken, for
  fear of my bacon, either man, wife, or babe.' (Old Anglo-Irish poem.)</p>

  coarsely.</p>

  <p>Ballyhooly, a village near Fermoy in Cork, formerly notorious for its
  faction fights, so that it has passed into a proverb. A man is late
  coming home and expects <i>Ballyhooly</i> from his wife, i.e. 'the length
  and breadth of her tongue.' Father Carroll has neglected to visit his
  relatives, the Kearneys, for a long time, so that he knows he's <i>in the
  black books</i> with Mrs. Kearney, and expects Ballyhooly from her the
  first time he meets her. ('Knocknagow.')</p>

  <p>Ballyorgan in Co. Limerick, <a href="#page146">146</a>.</p>

  <p>Banagher and Ballinasloe, <a href="#page192">192</a>.</p>

  <p>Banshee´; a female fairy: Irish <i>bean-sidhe</i> [banshee], a 'woman
  from the <i>shee</i> or fairy-dwelling.' This was the original meaning;
  but in modern times, and among English speakers, the word <i>banshee</i>
  has become narrowed in its application, and signifies a female spirit
  that attends certain families, and is heard <i>keening</i> or crying
  aloud at night round the house when some member of the family is about to
  die.</p>

  generally applied to the green field near the homestead where the cows
  are brought to be milked.</p>

  <p>Bawneen; a loose whitish jacket of home-made undyed flannel worn by
  men at out-door work. Very general: <i>banyan</i> in Derry. From Irish
  <i>bán</i> [bawn], whitish, with the diminutive termination.</p>

  <p>Bawnoge; a dancing-green. (MacCall: Leinster.) <!-- Page 215 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page215"></a>{215}</span>From <i>bán</i> [baan],

  href="#page90">90</a>).</p>

  <p>Blackfast: among Roman Catholics, there is a 'black fast' on Ash
  Wednesday, Spy Wednesday, and Good Friday, i.e. no flesh meat or
  <i>whitemeat</i> is allowed&mdash;no flesh, butter, eggs, cheese, or
  milk.</p>

  were called 'Ribbonmen.' Some of them acknowledged the priests: those

  <p>Black swop. When two fellows have two wretched articles&mdash;such as
  two old penknives&mdash;each thinking his own to be the worst in the
  universe, they sometimes agree for the pure humour of the thing to make a
  <i>black swop</i>, i.e. to swop without first looking at the articles.
  When they are looked at after the swop, there is always great fun. (See
  Hool.)</p>

  <p>Blarney; smooth, plausible, cajoling talk. From Blarney Castle near
  Cork, in which there is a certain stone hard to reach, with this virtue,
  that if a person kisses it, he will be endowed with the gift of
  <i>blarney</i>.</p>

  <p>Blast; when a child suddenly fades in health and pines away, he has
  got a blast,&mdash;i.e. a puff of evil wind sent by some baleful sprite
  has struck him. <i>Blast</i> when applied to fruit or crops means a
  blight in the ordinary sense&mdash;nothing supernatural.</p>

  <p>Blather, bladdher; a person who utters vulgarly foolish boastful talk:
  used also as a verb&mdash;to blather. Hence <i>blatherumskite</i>,
  applied to a person or to his talk in much the same sense; 'I never heard
  such a blatherumskite.' Ulster and Scotch form <i>blether</i>,
  <i>blethering</i>: Burns speaks of stringing 'blethers up in rhyme.'
  ('The Vision.')</p>

  <p>Blaze, blazes, blazing: favourite words everywhere in Ireland. Why are
  you in such a blazing hurry? Jack ran away like blazes: now work at that
  job like blazes: he is blazing drunk. Used also by the English
  <i>peasantry</i>:&mdash;'That's a blazing strange <!-- Page 217 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page217"></a>{217}</span>answer,' says Jerry
  Cruncher in 'A Tale of Two Cities.' There's a touch of slang in some of
  these: yet the word has been in a way made classical by Lord Morley's
  expression that Lord Salisbury never made a speech without uttering 'some
  blazing indiscretion.'</p>

  <p>Blind Billy. In coming to an agreement take care you don't make 'Blind
  Billy's Bargain,' by either overreaching yourself or allowing the other
  party to overreach you. Blind Billy was the hangman in Limerick, and on
  one particular occasion he flatly refused to do his work unless he got
  £50 down on the nail: so the high sheriff had to agree and the hangman
  put the money in his pocket. When all was over the sheriff refused
  point-blank to send the usual escort without a fee of £50 down. So Blind
  Billy had to hand over the £50&mdash;for if he went without an escort he
  would be torn in pieces&mdash;and had nothing in the end for his job.</p>

  <p>Blind lane; a lane stopped up at one end.</p>

  <p>Blind window; an old window stopped up, but still plain to be
  seen.</p>

  <p>Blink; to exercise an evil influence by a glance of the 'evil eye'; to

  not come in churning, the milk has been <i>blinked</i> by some one.</p>

  <p>Blirt; to weep: as a noun, a rainy wind. (Ulster.)</p>

  <p>Blob (<i>blab</i> often in Ulster), a raised blister: a drop of honey,

  <i>boithreán</i> [boarhaun], from bo, a cow.</p>

  <p>Boccach [accented on 2nd syll. in Munster, but elsewhere on 1st]; a
  lame person. From the fact that so many beggars are lame or pretend to be
  lame, <i>boccach</i> has come to mean a beggar. Irish <i>bacach</i>, a
  lame person: from <i>bac</i>, to halt. <i>Bockady</i>, another form of
  <i>boccach</i> in Munster. <i>Bockeen</i> (the diminutive added on to
  <i>bac</i>), another form heard in Mayo.</p>

  <p>Boddagh [accented on 2nd syll. in Munster; in Ulster on 1st], a rich
  churlish clownish fellow. Tom Cuddihy wouldn't bear insult from any
  purse-proud old <i>boddagh</i>. ('Knocknagow.')</p>

  (Limerick.)</p>

  <i>bog</i>, soft. Bog (verb), to be bogged; to sink in a bog or any soft
  soil or swampy place.</p>

  <p>Bog-butter; butter found deep in bogs, where it had been buried in old
  times for a purpose, and forgotten: a good deal changed now by the action
  of the bog. (See Joyce's 'Smaller Soc. Hist. of Anc. Ireland,' p.
  260.)</p>

  <p>Bog-Latin; bad incorrect Latin; Latin that had been learned in the
  hedge schools among the bogs. This derisive and reproachful epithet was
  given in bad old times by pupils and others of the favoured, legal, and
  endowed schools, sometimes with reason, <!-- Page 219 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page219"></a>{219}</span>but oftener very
  unjustly. For those <i>bog</i> or hedge schools sent out numbers of
  scholarly men, who afterwards entered the church or lay professions. (See
  p. <a href="#page151">151</a>.)</p>

  <p>Boghaleen; the same as Crusheen, which see.</p>

  <p>Boliaun, also called <i>booghalaun bwee</i> and

  words.</p>

  <p>Bolting-hole; the second or backward entrance made by rats, mice,
  rabbits, &amp;c., from their burrows, so that if attacked at the ordinary
  entrance, they can escape by this, which is always left unused except in
  case of attack. (Kinahan.)</p>

  <p>Bones. If a person magnifies the importance of any matter and talks as
  if it were some great affair, the other will reply:&mdash;'Oh, you're
  <i>making great bones</i> about it.'</p>

  <p>Bonnive, a sucking-pig. Irish <i>banbh</i>, same sound and meaning.
  Often used with the diminutive&mdash;bonniveen, bonneen. 'Oh look at the
  <i>baby pigs</i>,' says an Irish lady one day in the hearing of others
  and myself, ashamed to use the Irish word. After that she always bore the
  nickname 'Baby pig':&mdash;'Oh, there's the Baby pig.'</p>

  <p>Bonnyclabber; thick milk. Irish <i>bainne</i> [bonny] milk; and
  <i>clabar</i>, anything thick or half liquid. 'In use all over America.'

  striking always in time. Irish <i>buail-an-triúr</i>, 'the striking of
  three.'</p>

  <p>Booley as a noun; a temporary settlement in the grassy uplands where
  the people of the adjacent lowland village lived during the summer with
  their cattle, and milked them and made butter, returning in
  autumn&mdash;cattle and all&mdash;to their lowland farms to take up the
  crops. Used as a verb also: <i>to booley</i>. See my 'Smaller Soc. Hist.
  of Anc. Ireland,' p. 431; or 'Irish Names of Places,' I. 239.</p>

  <p>Boolthaun, boulhaun, booltheen, boolshin: the striking part of a
  flail: from Irish <i>buail</i> [bool], to strike, with the
  diminutive.</p>

  <p>Boon in Ulster, same as <i>Mihul</i> elsewhere; which see.</p>

  <p>Boreen or bohereen, a narrow road. Irish <i>bóthar</i> [boher], a
  road, with the diminutive.</p>

  <p>Borick; a small wooden ball used by boys in hurling or goaling, when
  the proper leather-covered ball is not to hand. Called in Ulster a
  <i>nag</i> and also a <i>golley</i>. (Knowles.)</p>

  <p>Borreen-brack, 'speckled cake,' speckled with currants and raisins,
  from Irish <i>bairghin</i> [borreen], a cake, and <i>breac</i> [brack],
  speckled: specially baked for Hallow-eve. Sometimes corruptly called
  <i>barm-brack</i> or <i>barn-brack</i>.</p>

  <p>Bosthoon: a flexible rod or whip made of a number of green rushes laid
  together and bound up with single rushes wound round and round. Made by
  boys in play&mdash;as I often made them. Hence '<i>bosthoon</i>' is
  applied contemptuously to a soft <!-- Page 221 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page221"></a>{221}</span>worthless spiritless
  fellow, in much the same sense as <i>poltroon</i>.</p>

  <p>Bother; merely the Irish word <i>bodhar</i>, deaf, used both as a noun
  and a verb in English (in the sense of deafening, annoying, troubling,
  perplexing, teasing): a person deaf or partially deaf is said to be
  <i>bothered</i>:&mdash;'Who should come in but <i>bothered</i> Nancy Fay.
  Now be it known that <i>bothered</i> signifies deaf; and Nancy was a
  little old cranky <i>bothered</i> woman.' (Ir. Pen. Mag.) You 'turn the
  <i>bothered</i> ear' to a person when you do not wish to hear what he
  says or grant his request. In these applications <i>bother</i> is
  universal in Ireland among all classes&mdash;educated as well as
  uneducated: accordingly, as Murray notes, it was first brought into use
  by Irishmen, such as Sheridan, Swift, and Sterne; just as Irishmen of
  to-day are bringing into currency <i>galore</i>, <i>smithereens</i>, and
  many other Irish words. In its primary sense of deaf or to deafen,
  <i>bother</i> is used in the oldest Irish documents: thus in the Book of
  Leinster we have:&mdash;<i>Ro bodrais sind oc imradud do maic</i>, 'You
  have made us deaf (you have <i>bothered</i> us) talking about your son'
  (Kuno Meyer): and a similar expression is in use at the present day in
  the very common phrase 'don't <i>bother</i> me' (don't deafen me, don't
  annoy me), which is an exact translation of the equally common Irish
  phrase <i>ná bí am' bhodradh</i>. Those who derive <i>bother</i> from the
  English <i>pother</i> make a guess, and not a good one. See Bowraun.</p>

  <p>Bottheen, a short thick stick or cudgel: the Irish <i>bata</i> with
  the diminutive:&mdash;<i>baitin</i>.</p>

  <p>Bottom; a clue or ball of thread. One of the tricks <!-- Page 222
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222"></a>{222}</span>of girls on
  Hallow-eve to find out the destined husband is to go out to the limekiln
  at night with a ball of yarn; throw in the ball still holding the thread;
  re-wind the thread, till it is suddenly stopped; call out 'who
  <i>howlds</i> my bottom of yarn?' when she expects to hear the name of
  the young man she is to marry.</p>

  <p>Bouchal or boochal, a boy: the Irish <i>buachaill</i>, same
  meaning.</p>

  <p>Bouilly-bawn, white home-made bread of wheaten flour; often called

  make rude syringes. From Irish <i>banndal</i> or <i>bannlamh</i>, a
  <i>bandle</i> (which see), with the dim. termination <i>án</i>, I never
  saw true boundhalauns outside Munster.</p>

  href="#page161">161</a>.</p>

  <p>Bownloch, a sore on the sole of the foot always at the edge: from
  <i>bonn</i> the foot-sole [pron. bown in the South], and <i>loch</i> a
  mere termination. Also called a <i>Bine-lock</i>.</p>

  <p>Bowraun, a sieve-shaped vessel for holding or measuring out corn, with
  the flat bottom made of dried sheepskin stretched tight; sometimes used
  as a rude tambourine, from which it gets the name <i>bowraun</i>; Irish
  <i>bodhur</i> [pron. bower here], deaf, from the <i>bothered</i> or
  indistinct sound. (South.)</p>

  <p>Bow [to rhyme with <i>cow</i>]; a <i>banshee</i>, a <i>fetch</i> (both
  which see. MacCall: South Leinster). This word has come down to us from
  very old times, for it preserves the memory of <i>Bugh</i> [Boo], a
  <i>banshee</i> or fairy queen once very celebrated, the daughter of <!--
  Page 223 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page223"></a>{223}</span>Bove
  Derg king of the Dedannans or faery-race, of whom information will be
  obtained in the classical Irish story, 'The Fate of the Children of Lir,'
  the first in my 'Old Celtic Romances.' She has given her name to many
  hills all through Ireland. (See my 'Irish Names of Places,' I. 182, 183.
  See Bawshill.)</p>

  <p>Box and dice; used to denote the whole lot: I'll send you all the

  long after. (Crofton Croker: 'Ir. Fairy Legends.')</p>

  <p>Brablins: a crowd of children: a rabble. (Monaghan.)</p>

  <p>Bracket; speckled: a 'bracket cow.' Ir. <i>breac</i>, speckled.</p>

  <p>Braddach; given to mischief; roguish. Ir. <i>bradach</i>, a thief: in
  the same sense as when a mother says to her child, 'You young thief, stop
  that mischief.' Often applied to cows inclined to break down and cross
  fences. (Meath and Monaghan.)</p>

  <p>Brander; a gridiron. (North.) From Eng. <i>brand</i>.</p>

  acidity of the stomach with a flow of watery saliva from the mouth. Brash
  (North), a short turn at churning, or at anything; a stroke of the
  churndash: 'Give the churn a few brashes.' In Donegal you will hear
  'that's a good brash of hail.'</p>

  <p>Brave; often used as an intensive:&mdash;'This is a brave fine day';
  'that's a brave big dog': (Ulster.) Also fine or admirable 'a brave stack
  of hay': <!-- Page 224 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  over Ireland: almost in the same sense as in Gray's Elegy:&mdash;'Their
  furrow oft the stubborn glebe <i>has bróke</i>.'</p>

  <p>Break; to dismiss from employment: 'Poor William O'Donnell was
  <i>broke</i> last week.' This usage is derived from the Irish language;
  and a very old usage it is; for we read in the Brehon Laws:&mdash;'<i>Cid
  nod m-bris in fer-so a bo-airechus?</i>' 'What is it that breaks
  (dismisses, degrades) this man from his bo-aireship (i.e. from his
  position as <i>bo-aire</i> or chief)?' My car-driver asked me one
  time:&mdash;'Can an inspector of National Schools be broke, sir?' By
  which he meant could he be dismissed at any time without any cause.</p>

  <p>Breedoge [<i>d</i> sounded like <i>th</i> in <i>bathe</i>]; a figure
  dressed up to represent St. Brigit, which was carried about from house to
  house by a procession of boys and girls in the afternoon of the 31st Jan.
  (the eve of the saint's festival), to collect small money contributions.
  With this money they got up a little rustic evening party with a dance
  next day, 1st Feb. 'Breedoge' means 'little <i>Brighid</i> or
  <i>Brighit</i>,' <i>Breed</i> (or rather <i>Breedh</i>) representing the
  sound of Brighid, with <i>óg</i> the old diminutive feminine
  termination.</p>

  <p>Brillauns or brill-yauns, applied to the poor articles of furniture in

  soon as they can gather up the few <i>brill-yauns</i> of furniture.

  suppose from <i>broc</i>, a badger. (Ulster.)</p>

  <p>Brogue, a shoe: Irish <i>bróg</i>. Used also to designate the Irish
  accent in speaking English: for the old Irish thong-stitched brogue was
  considered so characteristically Irish that the word was applied to our
  accent; as a clown is called a <i>cauboge</i> (which see: Munster).</p>

<p><!-- Page 226 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page226"></a>{226}</span></p>

  <p>Caulcannon, Calecannon, Colecannon, Kalecannon; potatoes mashed with

  <i>cess</i> or contribution; which receives some little support from its
  use in Louth to mean 'a quantity of corn in for threshing.'</p>

  <p>Chalk Sunday; the first Sunday after Shrove Tuesday (first Sunday in
  Lent), when those young men who should have been married, but were not,
  were marked with a heavy streak of chalk on the back of the <i>Sunday
  coat</i>, by boys who carried bits of chalk in their pockets for that
  purpose, and lay in wait for the bachelors. The marking was done while
  the congregation were assembling for Mass: and the young fellow ran for
  his life, always laughing, and often singing the concluding words of some
  suitable doggerel such as:&mdash;'And you are not married though Lent has
  come!' This custom prevailed in Munster. I saw it in full play in

  name="page238"></a>{238}</span>beginning of many of the

  to be reproachful, originated among ourselves, after the usual habit of
  many 'superior' Irishmen to vilify their own country and countrymen and
  all their customs and peculiarities. Observe, this opening is almost
  equally common in English Folk-songs; yet the English do not make game of
  them by nicknames. Irish music, which is thus vilified by some of our
  brethren, is the most beautiful Folk Music in the world.</p>

  <p>The <i>Cruiskeen Laun</i> is the name of a well-known Irish
  air&mdash;the Scotch call it 'John Anderson my Jo.' Irish
  <i>cruiscín</i>, a pitcher: <i>lán</i> [laun], full: i.e. in this case
  full of <i>pottheen</i>.</p>

  <p>Crusheen; a stick with a flat crosspiece fastened at bottom for
  washing potatoes in a basket. Irish <i>cros</i>, a cross, with the
  diminutive. Also called a <i>boghaleen</i>, from Irish <i>bachal</i>, a
  staff, with diminutive. (Joyce: Limerick.)</p>

  spittle-like substance often found on leaves of plants in summer, with a
  little greenish insect in the middle of it. (Limerick.)</p>

  had a great <i>cugger-mugger</i>. Irish <i>cogar</i>, whisper, with a
  similar duplication meaning nothing, like tip-top, shilly-shally,

  class="pagenum"><a name="page244"></a>{244}</span>'hugger-mugger' is a
  form of this: for <i>hugger</i> can't be derived from anything, whereas
  <i>cugger</i> (<i>cogur</i>) is a plain Irish word.</p>

  <p>Cull; when the best of a lot of any kind&mdash;sheep, cattle, books,
  &amp;c.&mdash;have been picked out, the bad ones that are left&mdash;the
  refuse&mdash;are the <i>culls</i>. (Kinahan: general.)</p>

  <p>Culla-greefeen; when foot or hand is 'asleep' with the feeling of
  'pins and needles.' The name is Irish and means 'Griffin's sleep'; but
  why so called I cannot tell. (Munster.)</p>

  <p>Cup-tossing; reading fortunes from tea-leaves thrown out on the saucer
  from the tea-cup or teapot. (General.)</p>

  <p>Cur; a twist: a <i>cur</i> of a rope. (Joyce: Limerick.)</p>

  Irish: Mayo.)</p>

  <p>Daisy-picker; a person who accompanies two lovers in their walk; why
  so called obvious. Brought to keep off gossip.</p>

  <p>Dalk, a thorn. (De Vismes Kane: North and South.) Irish <i>dealg</i>
  [dallog], a thorn.</p>

  <p>Dallag [<i>d</i> sounded like <i>th</i> in <i>that</i>]; any kind of
  covering to blindfold the eyes (Morris: South Monaghan): 'blinding,' from
  Irish <i>dall</i>, blind.</p>

  <p>Dallapookeen; blindman's buff. (Kerry.) From Irish <i>dalladh</i>
  [dalla] blinding; and <i>puicín</i> [pookeen], a covering over the
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Daltheen [the <i>d</i> sounded like <i>th</i> in <i>that</i>], an
  impudent conceited little fellow: a diminutive of <i>dalta</i>, a foster
  child. The diminutive <i>dalteen</i> was first applied to a horseboy,
  from which it has drifted to its present meaning.</p>

  <p>Dancing customs, <a href="#page170">170</a>, <a

  <p>Dannagh; mill-dust and mill-grains for feeding pigs. (Moran: Carlow:

  <p>Dander [second <i>d</i> sounded like <i>th</i> in <i>hither</i>], to
  walk about leisurely: a leisurely walk.</p>

  <p>Dandy; a small tumbler; commonly used for drinking punch.</p>

  <p>Darradail or daradeel [the <i>d</i>'s sounded like <i>th</i> in
  <i>that</i>] a sort of long black chafer or beetle. It raises its tail
  when disturbed, and has a strong smell of apples. There is a religious
  legend that when our Lord was escaping from the Jews, barefoot, the
  stones were marked all along by traces of blood from the bleeding feet.
  The daradail followed the traces of blood; and the Jews following, at
  length overtook and apprehended our Lord. Hence the people regard the
  daradail with intense hatred, and whenever they come on it, kill it
  instantly. Irish <i>darbh-daol</i>.</p>

  <p>Dark; blind: 'a dark man.' (Very general.) Used constantly even in

  <p>Devil, The, and his 'territory,' <a href="#page56">56</a>.</p>

  <p>Dickonce; one of the disguised names of the devil used in <i>white</i>
  cursing: 'Why then the dickonce take you for one gander.' (Gerald
  Griffin.)</p>

  <p>Diddy; a woman's pap or breast: a baby sucks its mother's diddy.
  Diminutive of Irish <i>did</i>, same.</p>

  <p>Dido; a girl who makes herself ridiculous with fantastic finery.
  (Moran: Carlow.)</p>

  <p>Didoes (singular <i>dido</i>); tricks, antics: 'quit your didoes.'
  (Ulster.)</p>

  <p>Dildron or dildern; a bowraun, which see.</p>

  <p>Dillesk, dulsk, dulse or dilse; a sort of sea plant growing on rocks,
  formerly much used (when dried) as an article of food (as
  <i>kitchen</i>), and still eaten in single leaves as a sort of relish.
  Still sold by basket-women in Dublin. Irish <i>duilesc</i>.</p>

  <p>Dip. When the family dinner consisted of dry potatoes, i.e. potatoes
  without milk or any other drink, dip was often used, that is to say,
  gravy or broth, or water flavoured in any way in plates, into which the
  potato was dipped at each bit. I once saw a man using dip of plain water
  with mustard in it, and eating his dinner with great relish. You will
  sometimes read of 'potatoes and point,' namely, that each person, before
  taking a bite, <i>pointed</i> the potato at a salt herring or a bit of
  bacon hanging in front of the chimney: but this is mere fun, and never
  occurred in real life.</p>

  <p>Disciple; a miserable looking creature of a man. Shane Glas was a long
  lean scraggy wretched looking fellow (but really strong and active), and
  another says to him&mdash;jibing and railing&mdash;'Away with ye, ye
  miserable <i>disciple</i>. Arrah, by the hole <!-- Page 248 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page248"></a>{248}</span>of my coat, after you
  dance your last jig upon nothing, with your hemp cravat on, I'll coax yer
  miserable carcase from the hangman to frighten the crows with.' (Edw.
  Walsh in 'Pen. Journ.')</p>

  <p>Disremember; to forget. Good old English; now out of fashion in
  England, but common in Ireland.</p>

  <p>Ditch. In Ireland a ditch is a raised fence or earthen wall or mound,
  and a dyke (or <i>sheuch</i> as they call it in Donegal and elsewhere in
  Ulster) is a deep cutting, commonly filled with water. In England both
  words mean exactly the reverse. Hence 'hurlers on the ditch,' or 'the
  best hurlers are on the ditch' (where speakers of pure English would use
  'fence') said in derision of persons who are mere idle spectators sitting
  up on high watching the game&mdash;whatever it may be&mdash;and boasting
  how they would <i>do the devil an' all</i> if they were only playing.
  Applied in a broad sense to those who criticise persons engaged in any
  strenuous affair&mdash;critics who think they could do better.</p>

  <p>Dollop; to adulterate: 'that coffee is dolloped.'</p>

  <p>Donny; weak, in poor health. Irish <i>donaidhe</i>, same sound and
  meaning. Hence <i>donnaun</i>, a poor weakly creature, same root with the
  diminutive. From still the same root is <i>donsy</i>, sick-looking.</p>

  <p>Donagh-dearnagh, the Sunday before Lammas (1st August). (Ulster.)
  Irish <i>Domnach</i>, Sunday; and <i>deireannach</i>, last, i.e. last
  Sunday of the period before 1st August.</p>

  <p>Doodoge [the two <i>d</i>'s sounded like <i>th</i> in <i>thus</i>]; a
  big pinch of snuff. [Limk.] Irish <i>dúdóg</i>.</p>

  <p>Dooraght [<i>d</i> sounded as in the last word]; tender care and
  kindness shown to a person. Irish <!-- Page 249 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page249"></a>{249}</span><i>dúthracht</i>, same
  sound and meaning. In parts of Ulster it means a small portion given over
  and above what is purchased (Simmons and Knowles); called elsewhere a
  <i>tilly</i>, which see. This word, in its sense of kindness, is very
  old; for in the Brehon Law we read of land set aside by a father for his
  daughter through <i>dooraght</i>.</p>

  <p>Doorshay-daurshay [<i>d</i> in both sounded as <i>th</i> in
  <i>thus</i>], mere hearsay or gossip. The first part is Irish,
  representing the sound of <i>dubhairt-sé</i>, 'said he.' The second part
  is a mere doubling of the first, as we find in many English words, such
  as 'fiddle-faddle,' 'tittle-tattle' (which resembles our word). Often
  used by Munster lawyers in court, whether Irish-speaking or not, in
  depreciation of hearsay evidence in contradistinction to the evidence of
  looking-on. 'Ah, that's all mere <i>doorshay-daurshay</i>.' Common all
  over Munster. The information about the use of the term in law courts I
  got from Mr. Maurice Healy. A different form is sometimes
  heard:&mdash;<i>D'innis bean dom gur innis bean di</i>, 'a woman told me
  that a woman told her.'</p>

  <p>Dornoge [<i>d</i> sounded as in doodoge above]; a small round lump of
  a stone, fit to be cast from the hand. Irish <i>dorn</i>, the shut hand,
  with the dim. <i>óg</i>.</p>

  <p>Double up; to render a person helpless either in fight or in argument.
  The old tinker in the fair got a blow of an amazon's fist which 'sent him
  sprawling and <i>doubled</i> him up for the rest of the evening.' (Robert
  Dwyer Joyce: 'Madeline's Vow.')</p>

  <p>Down in the heels; broken down in fortune (one mark of which is the
  state of the heels of shoes). <!-- Page 250 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page250"></a>{250}</span></p>

  <p>Down blow; a heavy or almost ruinous blow of any kind:&mdash;'The loss
  of that cow was a down blow to poor widow Cleary.'</p>

  <p>Downface; to persist boldly in an assertion (whether true or no): He
  downfaced me that he returned the money I lent him, though he never
  did.</p>

  <p>Down-the-banks; a scolding, a reprimand, punishment of any kind.</p>

  <p>Dozed: a piece of timber is dozed when there is a dry rot in the heart
  of it. (Myself for Limk.: Kane for North.)</p>

  <p>Drad; a grin or contortion of the mouth. (Joyce.)</p>

  <p>Drag home. (Simmons; Armagh: same as Hauling home, which see.)</p>

  <p>Drass; a short time, a turn:&mdash;'You walk a drass now and let me
  ride': 'I always smoke a drass before I go to bed of a night.'
  ('Collegians,' Limerick.) Irish <i>dreas</i>, same sound and meaning.</p>

  <p>Drench: a form of the English <i>drink</i>, but used in a peculiar
  sense in Ireland. A <i>drench</i> is a philtre, a love-potion, a
  love-compelling drink over which certain charms were repeated during its
  preparation. Made by boiling certain herbs (<i>orchis</i>) in water or
  milk, and the person drinks it unsuspectingly. In my boyhood time a
  beautiful young girl belonging to a most respectable family ran off with
  an ill-favoured obscure beggarly diseased wretch. The occurrence was
  looked on with great astonishment and horror by the people&mdash;no
  wonder; and the universal belief was that the fellow's old mother had
  given the poor girl a <i>drench</i>. To this hour I cannot make any guess
  at the cause of that astounding elopement: and it is <!-- Page 251
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page251"></a>{251}</span>not surprising
  that the people were driven to the supernatural for an explanation.</p>

  <p>Dresser; a set of shelves and drawers in a frame in a kitchen for
  holding plates, knives, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Drisheen is now used in Cork as an English word, to denote a sort of
  pudding made of the narrow intestines of a sheep, filled with blood that
  has been cleared of the red colouring matter, and mixed with meal and
  some other ingredients. So far as I know, this viand and its name are
  peculiar to Cork, where <i>drisheen</i> is considered suitable for
  persons of weak or delicate digestion. (I should observe that a recent
  reviewer of one of my books states that drisheen is also made in
  Waterford.) Irish <i>dreas</i> or driss, applied to anything slender, as
  a bramble, one of the smaller intestines, &amp;c.&mdash;with the
  diminutive.</p>

  <i>droch</i>, bad, evil. (See Eervar.)</p>

  <p>Droleen; a wren: merely the Irish word <i>dreóilín</i>.</p>

  <p>Drop; a strain of any kind 'running in the blood.' A man inclined to
  evil ways 'has a bad drop' in him (or 'a black drop'): a miser 'has a
  hard drop.' The expression carries an idea of heredity.</p>

  <p>Drugget; a cloth woven with a mixture of woollen and flaxen thread: so
  called from Drogheda where it was once extensively manufactured. Now much
  used as cheap carpeting.</p>

  <p>Druids and Druidism, <a href="#page178">178</a>.</p>

  <p>Drumaun; a wide back-band for a ploughing horse, <!-- Page 252
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page252"></a>{252}</span>with hooks to
  keep the traces in place. (Joyce: Limerick.) From Irish <i>druim</i>, the
  back.</p>

  <p>Drummagh; the back strap used in yoking two horses. (Joyce: Limerick.)
  Irish <i>druim</i>, the back, with the termination <i>-ach</i>,
  equivalent to English <i>-ous</i> and <i>-y</i>.</p>

  <p>Dry potatoes; potatoes eaten without milk or any other drink.</p>

  <p>Dry lodging; the use of a bed merely, without food.</p>

  <p>Drynaun-dun or drynan-dun [two <i>d</i>'s sounded like <i>th</i> in
  <i>that</i>]; the blackthorn, the sloe-bush. Irish <i>droigheanán</i>
  [drynan or drynaun], and <i>donn</i>, brown-coloured.</p>

  <p>Ducks; trousers of snow-white canvas, much used as summer wear by
  gentle and simple fifty or sixty years ago.</p>

  <p>Dudeen [both <i>d</i>'s sounded like <i>th</i> in <i>those</i>]; a
  smoking-pipe with a very short stem. Irish <i>dúidín</i>, <i>dúd</i>, a
  pipe, with the diminutive.</p>

  <p>Duggins; rags: 'that poor fellow is all in duggins.' (Armagh.)</p>

  <p>Dull; a loop or eye on a string. (Monaghan.)</p>

  <p>Dullaghan [<i>d</i> sounded as <i>th</i> in <i>those</i>]; a large
  trout. (Kane: Monaghan.) An Irish word.</p>

  <p>Dullaghan; 'a hideous kind of hobgoblin generally met with in
  churchyards, who can take off and put on his head at will.' (From 'Irish
  Names of Places,' I. 193, which see for more about this spectre. See
  Croker's 'Fairy Legends.')</p>

  <p>Dullamoo [<i>d</i> sounded like <i>th</i> in <i>those</i>]; a wastrel,
  a scapegrace, a <i>ne'er-do-weel</i>. Irish <i>dul</i>, going;
  <i>amudha</i> [amoo], astray, to loss:&mdash;<i>dullamoo</i>, 'a person
  going to the bad,' 'going to the dogs.' <!-- Page 253 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page253"></a>{253}</span></p>

  <p>Dundeen; a lump of bread without butter. (Derry.)</p>

  <p>Dunisheen; a small weakly child. (Moran: Carlow.) Irish
  <i>donaisín</i>, an unfortunate being; from <i>donas</i>, with
  diminutive. See Donny.</p>

  <p>Dunner; to knock loudly at a door. (Ulster.)</p>

  <p>Dunt (sometimes <i>dunch</i>), to strike or butt like a cow or goat
  with the head. A certain lame old man (of Armagh) was nicknamed 'Dunt the
  pad (path'). (Ulster.)</p>

  <p>Durneen, one of the two handles of a scythe that project from the main
  handle. Irish <i>doirnín</i>, same sound and meaning: diminutive from
  <i>dorn</i>, the fist, the shut hand.</p>

  cutters. (MacCall: Wexford.) <i>Dornoge</i>, given above, is the same
  word but differently applied.</p>

  <p>Earnest; 'in earnest' is often used in the sense of 'really and
  truly':&mdash;'You're a man in earnest, Cus, to strike the first blow on
  a day [of battle] like this.' (R. D. Joyce.)</p>

  <p>Eervar; the last pig in a litter. This <i>bonnive</i> being usually
  very small and hard to keep alive is often given to one of the children
  for a pet; and it is reared in great comfort in a warm bed by the kitchen
  fire, and fed on milk. I once, when a child, had an eervar of my own
  which was the joy of my life. Irish <i>iarmhar</i> [eervar], meaning
  'something after all the rest'; the hindmost. (Munster.) See Drogh for
  Ulster.</p>

  <p>Elder; a cow's udder. All over Ireland. <!-- Page 254 --><span

  <p>Elegant. This word is used among us, not in its proper sense, but to
  designate anything good or excellent of its kind:&mdash;An elegant
  penknife, an elegant gun: 'That's an elegant pig of yours, Jack?' Our
  milkman once offered me a present for my garden&mdash;'An elegant load of

  <p>Fair-gurthra; 'hungry grass.' There is a legend all through Ireland
  that small patches of grass grow here and there on mountains; and if a
  person in walking along happens to tread on one of them he is instantly
  overpowered with hunger so as to <!-- Page 255 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page255"></a>{255}</span>be quite unable to
  walk, and if help or food is not at hand he will sink down and perish.
  That persons are attacked and rendered helpless by sudden hunger on
  mountains in this manner is certain. Mr. Kinahan gives me an instance
  where he had to carry his companion, a boy, on his back a good distance
  to the nearest house: and Maxwell in 'Wild Sports of the West' gives
  others. But he offers the natural explanation: that a person is liable to
  sink suddenly with hunger if he undertakes a hard mountain walk with a
  long interval after food. Irish <i>feur</i>, grass; <i>gorta</i>,
  hunger.</p>

  <p>Fairy breeze. Sometimes on a summer evening you suddenly feel a very
  warm breeze: that is a band of fairies travelling from one fort to
  another; and people on such occasions usually utter a short prayer, not
  knowing whether the 'good people' are bent on doing good or evil. (G. H.
  Kinahan.) Like the Shee-geeha, which see.</p>

  <p>Fairy-thimble, the same as 'Lusmore,' which see.</p>

  <p>Famished; distressed for want of something:&mdash;'I am famished for a
  smoke&mdash;for a glass,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Farbreaga; a scarecrow. Irish <i>fear</i>, a man: <i>breug</i>
  falsehood: a false or pretended man.</p>

  cure&mdash;and when one meets another he (or she) asks in Irish '<i>ar
  ólish</i>,' 'did you drink?' In Kilkee the dogfish is called
  <i>Faumera</i>, for the dogfish is among the smaller fishes like what
  legend represents the Fomorians in Ireland.</p>

  God's pocket,' or 'as snug as in God's pocket.' I heard it said of a
  widow and orphans whose people were kind to them, that they were in
  'God's pocket.' Whether Seumas MacManus ever came across this term I do

  Peter's pocket</i>.'</p>

  <p>Gorsoon: a young boy. It is hard to avoid deriving this from French
  <i>garçon</i>, all the more as it has no root in Irish. Another form

  Munster towns I knew a man who kept a draper's shop, and who was always
  called <i>Gounau</i>, in accordance with the very reprehensible habit of
  our people to give nicknames.</p>

  <p>Graanshaghaun [<i>aa</i> long as in <i>car</i>]; wheat (in grain)
  boiled. (Joyce: Limerick.) In my early days what we called
  <i>graanshaghaun</i> was wheat in grains, not boiled, but roasted in an
  iron pot held over the fire, the wheat being kept stirred till done.</p>

  <p>Graffaun; a small axe with edge across like an adze for grubbing or
  <i>graffing</i> land, i.e. rooting out furze and heath in preparation for
  tillage. Used all through the South. 'This was the word used in Co. Cork

  says:&mdash;'Is it not the greatest pity in life ... that these

  <p>Half a one; half a glass of whiskey. One day a poor blind man walked
  into one of the Dublin branch banks, which happened to be next door to a
  public-house, and while the clerks were looking on, rather puzzled as to
  what he wanted, he slapped two pennies down on the counter; and in no
  very gentle voice:&mdash;'Half a one!'</p>

  <p>Half joke and whole earnest; an expression often heard in Ireland
  which explains itself. 'Tim told me&mdash;half joke and whole
  earnest&mdash;that he didn't much like to lend me his horse.'</p>

  <p>Hand; to make a hand of a person is to make fun of him; to humbug him:
  Lowry Looby, thinking that Mr. Daly is making game of him,
  says:&mdash;''Tis making a hand of me your honour is.' (Gerald Griffin.)
  Other applications of <i>hand</i> are 'You made a bad hand of that job,'
  i.e. you did it badly. If a man makes a foolish marriage: 'He made a bad
  hand of himself, poor fellow.'</p>

  <p>Hand-and-foot; the meaning of this very general expression is seen in
  the sentence 'He gave him a hand-and-foot and tumbled him down.'</p>

  <p>Hand's turn; a very trifling bit of work, an occasion:&mdash;'He won't
  do a hand's turn about the house': 'he scolds me at every hand's turn,'
  i.e. on every possible occasion.</p>

  <p>Handy; near, convenient:&mdash;'The shop lies handy to me'; an
  adaptation of the Irish <i>láimh le</i> (meaning <i>near</i>). <i>Láimh
  le Corcaig</i>, lit. <i>at hand with Cork</i>&mdash;near Cork. This again
  is often expressed <i>convenient to Cork</i>, where <i>convenient</i> is
  intended to mean simply <i>near</i>. So it comes that we in Ireland
  regard <i>convenient</i> and <i>near</i> as exactly synonymous, <!-- Page
  272 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page272"></a>{272}</span>which they
  are not. In fact on almost every possible occasion, we&mdash;educated and
  uneducated&mdash;use <i>convenient</i> when <i>near</i> would be the
  proper word. An odd example occurs in the words of the old Irish
  folk-song:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Hannel; a blow with the spear or spike of a pegging-top (or
  'castle-top') down on the wood of another top. Boys often played a game
  of tops for a certain number of hannels. At the end of the game the
  victor took his defeated opponent's top, sunk it firmly down into the
  grassy sod, and then with his own top in his hand struck the other top a
  number of hannels with the spear of his own to injure it as much as
  possible. 'Your castle-tops came in for the most hannels.'
  ('Knocknagow.')</p>

  <p>Hap; to wrap a person round with any covering, to tuck in the
  bedclothes round a person. (Ulster.)</p>

  bit of secret information:&mdash;'They were planning to betray and cheat
  me, but Ned gave me the hard word, and I was prepared for them, so that I
  defeated their schemes.'</p>

  <p>Hare; to make a hare of a person is to put him down in argument or
  discussion, or in a contest of wit or cunning; to put him in utter

  you.' (Carleton in Ir. Pen. Journ.)</p>

  <p>Harvest; always used in Ireland for autumn:&mdash;'One fine day in
  harvest.' (Crofton Croker.)</p>

  <p>Hauling home; bringing home the bride, soon after the wedding, to her
  husband's house. Called also a 'dragging-home.' It is always made the

  <p>Head or harp; a memorial of the old Irish coinage, corresponding with
  English <i>head or tail</i>. The old Irish penny and halfpenny had the

  <p>Hinten; the last sod of the ridge ploughed. (Ulster.)</p>

  <p>Ho; equal. Always used with a negative, and also in a bad sense,
  either seriously or in play. A child spills a jug of milk, and the mother
  says:&mdash;'Oh Jacky, there's no <i>ho</i> to you for mischief' (no
  equal to you). The old woman says to the mischievous
  gander:&mdash;'There's no ho with you for one gander.' (Gerald Griffin:
  'The Coiner.') This <i>ho</i> is an Irish word: it represents the sound
  of the Irish prefix <i>cho</i> or <i>chomh</i>, equal, as much as,
  &amp;c. 'There's no ho to Jack Lynch' means there's no one for whom you
  can use <i>cho</i> (equal) in comparing him with Jack Lynch.</p>

  <p>Hobbler; a small cock of fresh hay about 4 feet high. (Moran:
  Carlow.)</p>

  <p>Hobby; a kind of Irish horse, which, three or four centuries ago, was
  known all over Europe 'and held in great esteem for their easy amble: and
  from this kind of horse the Irish light-armed bodies of horse were called
  hobellers.' (Ware. See my 'Smaller Social History of Ancient Ireland,' p.
  487.) Hence a child's toy, a hobby-horse. Hence a favourite pursuit is
  called a 'hobby.'</p>

  <p>Hoil; a mean wretched dwelling: an uncomfortable situation. (Morris:
  South Monaghan.)</p>

  <p>Hollow; used as an adverb as follows:&mdash;'Jack Cantlon's horse beat

  <p>Holy well; a well venerated on account of its association with an
  Irish saint: in most cases retaining the name of the
  saint:&mdash;'Tober-Bride,' St. Bride's or Brigit's well. In these wells
  the early saints baptised their converts. They are found all through
  Ireland, and people often pray beside them and make their <i>rounds</i>.
  (See 'Smaller Social History of Ancient Ireland.')</p>

  <p>Hool or hooley; the same as a Black swop.</p>

  <p>Hot-foot; at once, immediately:&mdash;'Off I went hot-foot.' 'As soon

  <p>Hulk; a rough surly fellow. (Munster.) A bad person. (Simmons:
  Armagh.) Irish <i>olc</i>, bad.</p>

  <p>Hungry-grass: see Fair-gurtha.</p>

  <p>Hunker-slide; to slide on ice sitting on the hunkers (or as they would
  say in Munster, sitting on one's <i>grug</i>) instead of standing up
  straight: hence to act with duplicity: to shirk work:&mdash;'None of your
  hunker-sliding for me.' (Ulster.)</p>

  <p>Hurling; the common game of ball and hurley or <i>commaun</i>. The
  chief terms (besides those mentioned elsewhere) are:&mdash;<i>Puck</i>,
  the blow of the hurley on the ball: The <i>goals</i> are the two gaps at
  opposite sides of the field through which the players try to drive the
  ball. When the ball is thrown high up between two players with their <!--
  Page 276 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page276"></a>{276}</span>commauns ready drawn to try which will
  strike it on its way down: that is <i>high-rothery</i>. When two adjacent
  parishes or districts contended (instead of two small parties at an
  ordinary match), that was <i>scoobeen</i> or 'conquering goal' (Irish
  <i>scuab</i>, a broom: <i>scoobeen</i>, <i>sweeping</i> the ball away). I
  have seen at least 500 on each side engaged in one of these
  <i>scoobeens</i>; but that was in the time of the eight
  millions&mdash;before 1847. Sometimes there were bad blood and dangerous
  quarrels at scoobeens. See Borick, Sippy, Commaun, and Cool. (For the
  ancient terms see my 'Smaller Social History of Ancient Ireland,' p.
  513.) For examples of these great contests, see Very Rev. Dr. Sheehan's
  'Glenanaar,' pp. 4, 231.</p>

  <i>whort</i>. (Munster.)</p>

  <p>Husho or rather huzho; a lullaby, a nurse-song, a cradle-song;
  especially the chorus, consisting of a sleepy <i>cronaun</i> or
  croon&mdash;like 'shoheen-sho Loo-lo-lo,' &amp;c. Irish
  <i>suantraighe</i> [soontree]. 'The moaning of a distant stream that kept
  up a continual <i>cronane</i> like a nurse <i>hushoing</i>.' 'My mother
  was hushoing my little sister, striving to quieten her.' (Both from
  Crofton Croker.) 'The murmur of the ocean <i>huzhoed</i> me to sleep.'

  <p>If; often used in the sense of <i>although</i>, <i>while</i>, or some

  other man seized him round the waist and threw him on his back.'</p>

  <p>If that. This is old English, but has quite disappeared from the
  standard language of the present day, though still not unfrequently heard
  in Ireland:&mdash;'If that you go I'll go with you.'</p>

  <p>Inagh´ or in-yah´ [both strongly accented on second syll.]; a
  satirical expression of dissent or disbelief, like the English
  <i>forsooth</i>, but much stronger. A fellow boasting says:&mdash;'I
  could run ten miles in an hour': and another replies, 'You could
  <i>inah</i>': meaning 'Of course I don't believe a word of it.' A man
  coming back from the other world says to a woman:&mdash;'I seen your

  <i>inah</i>.' (Gerald Griffin: 'Collegians.') Irish <i>an eadh</i>, same

  <p>Leprachaun; a sort of fairy, called by several names in different
  parts of Ireland:&mdash;luricaun, cluricaun, lurragadaun, loghryman,
  luprachaun. This last is the nearest to the Gaelic original, all the
  preceding anglicised forms being derived from it. Luprachaun itself is
  derived by a metathesis from Irish <i>luchorpán</i>, from <i>lu</i>,
  little, and <i>corpán</i>, the dim. of <i>corp</i>, a body:&mdash;'weeny
  little body.' The reader will understand all about this merry little chap
  from the following short note and song written by me and extracted from
  my 'Ancient Irish Music' (in which the air also will be found). The
  leprachaun is a very tricky little fellow, usually dressed in a green
  coat, red cap, and knee-breeches, and silver shoe-buckles, whom you may
  sometimes see in the shades of evening, or by moonlight, under a bush;
  and he is generally making or mending a shoe: moreover, like almost all
  fairies, he would give the world for <i>pottheen</i>. If you catch him
  and hold him, he will, after a little threatening, show you where
  treasure is hid, or give you a purse in which you will always find money.
  But if you once take your eyes off him, he is gone in an instant; and he
  is very ingenious in devising tricks to induce you to look round. It is
  very hard to catch a leprachaun, and still harder to hold him. I never
  heard of any man who succeeded in getting treasure from him, except one,
  a lucky young fellow named MacCarthy, who, according to the peasantry,
  built the castle of Carrigadrohid near Macroom in Cork with the money.
  Every Irishman understands well the terms <i>cruiskeen</i> and
  <i>mountain dew</i>, some indeed a little too well; but <!-- Page 285
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page285"></a>{285}</span>for the
  benefit of the rest of the world, I think it better to state that a
  <i>cruískeen</i> is a small jar, and that <i>mountain dew</i> is
  <i>pottheen</i> or illicit whiskey.</p>

  <p>Likes; 'the likes of you': persons or <i>a person</i> like you or in

  the likes of him.' Colonel Lake, Inspector General of Constabulary in
  last century, one afternoon met one of his recruits on the North Circular
  Road, Dublin, showing signs of liquor, and stopped him. 'Well, my good
  fellow, what is your name please?' The recruit replied:&mdash;'Who are
  you, and what right have you to ask my name?' 'I am Colonel Lake, your
  inspector general.' The recruit eyed him closely:&mdash;'Oh begor your
  honour, if that's the case it's not right for the likes of me to be
  talking to the likes of you': on which he turned round and took leg bail
  on the spot like a deer, leaving <!-- Page 287 --><span

  standing on the pathway. The Colonel often afterwards told that story

  English you very often hear:&mdash;'Oh the master is very mad with you,'
  <!-- Page 290 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page290"></a>{290}</span>i.e. angry. 'Excessively angry' is often
  expressed this way in dialect language:&mdash;'The master is blazing mad
  about that accident to the mare.' But even this expression is classical
  Irish; for we read in the Irish Bible that Moses went away from Pharaoh,
  <i>air lasadh le feírg</i>, 'blazing with anger.' 'Like mad' is often

  Fear suas</i> occurs in the Ossianic Poems. Hence they use this term all
  through the South:&mdash;'As cunning as he is he can't hide his knavery
  from <i>the Man above</i>.'</p>

  <p>Man in the gap, <a href="#page182">182</a>.</p>

  were in rivalry of any kind, whether of wit, of learning, or of
  strength:&mdash;'James was too many for Dick,' meaning he was an

  <p>Mills. The old English game of 'nine men's morris' or 'nine men's

  boy. We played it on a diagram of three squares one within another,
  connected by certain straight lines, each player having nine counters. It
  is mentioned by Shakespeare ('Midsummer-Night's Dream'). I learned to be
  a good player, and could play it still if I could meet an antagonist. How
  it reached Limerick I do not know. A few years ago I saw two persons
  playing mills in a hotel in Llandudno; and my heart went out to them.

  common use in England until the change of religion at the Reformation;

  everywhere. But the practice is kept up by Catholics all over the world.

  settlement. (Healy.)</p>

  <p>Overright; opposite, in front of: the same meaning as
  <i>forenenst</i>; but <i>forenenst</i> is English, while overright is a
  wrong translation from an Irish word&mdash;<i>ós-cómhair</i>. <i>Os</i>
  means over, and <i>comhair</i> opposite: but this last word was taken by
  speakers to be <i>cóir</i> (for both are sounded alike), and as
  <i>cóir</i> means <i>right</i> or just, so they translated
  <i>os-comhair</i> as if it were <i>ós-cóir</i>, 'over-right.' (Russell:

  <p>Place; very generally used for house, home, homestead:&mdash;'If ever
  you come to Tipperary I shall be very glad to see you at <i>my
  place</i>.' This is a usage of the Irish language; for the word
  <i>baile</i> [bally], which is now used for <i>home</i>, means also, and

  <p>Pooka; a sort of fairy: a mischievous and often malignant goblin that
  generally appears in the form of a horse, but sometimes as a bull, a
  buck-goat, &amp;c. The great ambition of the pooka horse is to get some
  unfortunate wight on his back; and then he gallops furiously through
  bogs, marshes, and woods, over rocks, glens, and precipices; till at last
  when the poor wretch on his back is nearly dead with terror and fatigue,
  the pooka pitches him into some quagmire or pool or briar-brake, leaving
  him to extricate himself as best he can. But the goblin does not do
  worse: he does not kill people. Irish <i>púca</i>. Shakespeare has
  immortalised him as Puck, the goblin of 'A Midsummer-Night's Dream.'</p>

  <p>Pookeen; a play&mdash;blindman's buff: from Irish <i>púic</i>, a veil
  or covering, from the covering put over the eyes. Pookeen is also applied
  in Cork to a cloth muzzle tied on calves or lambs to prevent sucking the
  mother. The face-covering for blindman's buff is called <i>pookoge</i>,
  in which the dim. <i>óg</i> is used instead of <i>ín</i> or <i>een</i>.
  The old-fashioned <i>coal-scuttle</i> bonnets of long ago that nearly
  covered the face were often called <i>pookeen</i> bonnets. It was of a
  bonnet of this kind that the young man in Lover's song of 'Molly Carew'
  speaks:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Oh, <i>lave</i> off that bonnet or else I'll <i>lave</i> on it</p>

  see)&mdash;any small things, such as marbles, &amp;c. (South:

  <p>Porter-meal: oatmeal mixed with porter. Seventy or eighty years ago,
  the carters who carried bags of oatmeal from Limerick to Cork (a two-day
  journey) usually rested for the night at Mick Lynch's public-house in
  Glenosheen. They often took lunch or dinner of porter-meal in this
  way:&mdash;Opening the end of one of the bags, the man made a hollow in
  the oatmeal into which he poured a quart of porter, stirring it up with a
  spoon: then he ate an immense bellyful of the mixture. But those fellows
  could digest like an ostrich. <!-- Page 305 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page305"></a>{305}</span></p>

  <p>In Ulster, oatmeal mixed in this manner with buttermilk, hot broth,
  &amp;c., and eaten with a spoon, is called <i>croudy</i>.</p>

  <p>Potthalowng; an awkward unfortunate mishap, not very serious, but
  coming just at the wrong time. When I was a boy 'Jack Mullowney's
  <i>potthalowng</i>' had passed into a proverb. Jack one time went
  <i>courting</i>, that is, to spend a pleasant evening with the young lady
  at the house of his prospective father-in-law, and to make up the match
  with the old couple. He wore his best of course, body-coat, white
  waistcoat, caroline hat (tall silk), and <i>ducks</i> (ducks, snow-white
  canvas trousers.) All sat down to a grand dinner given in his honour, the
  young couple side by side. Jack's plate was heaped up with beautiful
  bacon and turkey, and white cabbage swimming in fat, that would make you
  lick your lips to look at it. Poor Jack was a bit sheepish; for there was
  a good deal of banter, as there always is on such occasions. He drew over
  his plate to the very edge of the table; and in trying to manage a turkey
  bone with knife and fork, he turned the plate right over into his lap,
  down on the ducks.</p>

  <p>The marriage came off all the same; but the story went round the
  country like wildfire; and for many a long day Jack had to stand the
  jokes of his friends on the <i>potthalowng</i>. Used in Munster. The
  Irish is <i>patalong</i>, same sound and meaning; but I do not find it in
  the dictionaries.</p>

  <p>Pottheen; illicit whiskey: always distilled in some remote lonely
  place, as far away as possible from the nose of a gauger. It is the Irish
  word <i>poitín</i> <!-- Page 306 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page306"></a>{306}</span>[pottheen], little pot. We have partly the
  same term still; for everyone knows the celebrity of <i>pot</i>-still
  whiskey: but this is <i>Parliament</i> whiskey, not <i>pottheen</i>, see
  p. <a href="#page174">174</a>.</p>

  <p>Power; a large quantity, a great deal: Jack Hickey has a power of
  money: there was a <i>power of cattle in the fair yesterday</i>: there's
  a power of ivy on that old castle. Miss Grey, a small huckster who kept a
  little vegetable shop, was one day showing off her rings and bracelets to
  our servant. 'Oh Miss Grey,' says the girl, 'haven't you a terrible lot
  of them.' 'Well Ellen, you see I want them all, for I go into <i>a power
  of society</i>.' This is an old English usage as is shown by this extract
  from Spenser's 'View':&mdash;'Hee also [Robert Bruce] sent over his said
  brother Edward, with a power of Scottes and Red-Shankes into Ireland.'
  There is a corresponding Irish expression (<i>neart airgid</i>, a power
  of money), but I think this is translated from English rather than the
  reverse. The same idiom exists in Latin with the word <i>vis</i> (power):
  but examples will not be quoted, as they would take up a power of
  space.</p>

  <p>Powter [<i>t</i> sounded like <i>th</i> in <i>pith</i>]; to root the
  ground like a pig; to root up potatoes from the ground with the hands.
  (Derry.)</p>

  <p>Prashagh, more commonly called prashagh-wee; wild cabbage with yellow
  blossoms, the rape plant. Irish <i>praiseach-bhuidhe</i> [prashagh-wee],
  yellow cabbage. <i>Praiseach</i> is borrowed from Latin
  <i>brassica</i>.</p>

  <p>Prashameen; a little group all clustered together:&mdash;'The children
  sat in a prashameen on the floor.' I have heard this word a hundred times
  in Limerick <!-- Page 307 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page307"></a>{307}</span>among English speakers: its Irish form
  should be <i>praisimín</i>, but I do not find it in the dictionaries.</p>

  <p>Prashkeen; an apron. Common all over Ireland. Irish <i>praiscín</i>,
  same sound and meaning.</p>

  <p>Prawkeen; raw oatmeal and milk (MacCall: South Leinster.) See
  Porter-meal.</p>

  <p>Presently; at present, now:&mdash;'I'm living in the country
  presently.' A Shakespearian survival:&mdash;Prospero:&mdash;'Go bring the
  rabble.' Ariel:&mdash;'Presently?' [i.e. shall I do so now?]
  Prospero:&mdash;'Ay, with a wink.' Extinct in England, but preserved and
  quite common in Ireland.</p>

  <p>Priested; ordained: 'He was priested last year.'</p>

  <p>Priest's share; the soul. A mother will say to a refractory
  child:&mdash;'I'll knock the priest's share out of you.' (Moran:
  Carlow.)</p>

  <p>Protestant herring: Originally applied to a bad or a stale herring:
  but in my boyhood days it was applied, in our neighbourhood, to almost
  anything of an inferior quality:&mdash;'Oh that butter is a Protestant
  herring.' Here is how it originated:&mdash;Mary Hewer of our village had
  been for time out of mind the only huckster who sold salt herrings,
  sending to Cork for a barrel from time to time, and making good profit.
  At last Poll Alltimes sent for a barrel and set up an opposition shop,
  taking away a large part of Mary's custom. Mary was a Catholic and Poll a
  Protestant: and then our herrings became sharply distinguished as
  Catholic herrings and Protestant herrings: each party eating herrings
  <!-- Page 308 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page308"></a>{308}</span>of their own creed. But after some time a
  horrible story began to go round&mdash;whispered at first under people's
  breath&mdash;that Poll found <i>the head of a black</i> with long hair
  packed among the herrings half way down in her barrel. Whether the people
  believed it or not, the bare idea was enough; and Protestant herrings
  suddenly lost character, so that poor Poll's sale fell off at once, while
  Mary soon regained all her old customers. She well deserved it, if anyone
  ever deserved a reward for a master-stroke of genius. But I think this is
  all 'forgotten lore' in the neighbourhood now.</p>

  <p>Proverbs, <a href="#page105">105</a>.</p>

  <p>Puck; to play the puck with anything: a softened equivalent of
  <i>playing the devil</i>. <i>Puck</i> here means the Pooka, which
  see.</p>

  <p>Puck; a blow:&mdash;'He gave him a puck of a stick on the head.' More
  commonly applied to a punch or blow of the horns of a cow or goat. 'The
  cow gave him a puck (or pucked him) with her horns and knocked him down.'
  The blow given by a hurler to the ball with his <i>caman</i> or hurley is
  always called a <i>puck</i>. Irish <i>poc</i>, same sound and
  meaning.</p>

  <p>Puckaun; a he-goat. (South.) Irish <i>poc</i>, a he-goat, with the
  diminutive.</p>

  <p>Puke; a poor puny unhealthy-looking person.</p>

  <p>Pusheen; the universal word for a kitten in Munster: a diminutive of
  the English word <i>puss</i>; exactly equivalent to <i>pussy</i>.</p>

  <p>Puss [<i>u</i> sounded as in <i>full</i>]; the mouth and lips, always
  used <i>in dialect</i> in an offensive or contemptuous sense:&mdash;'What
  an ugly <i>puss</i> that fellow has.' 'He had a puss on him,' i.e. he
  looked sour or displeased&mdash;with lips contracted. I heard one boy say
  to another:&mdash;'I'll give you a <i>skelp</i> (blow) on the puss.'
  (General.) Irish <i>pus</i>, the mouth, same sound.</p>

  <p>Pusthaghaun; a puffed up conceited fellow. The corresponding word
  applied to a girl is <i>pusthoge</i> (MacCall: Wexford): the diminutive
  termination <i>aun</i> or <i>chaun</i> being masculine and <i>óg</i>
  feminine. Both are from <i>pus</i> the mouth, on account of the
  consequential way a conceited person squares up the lips.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Quaw or quagh; a <i>quag</i> or quagmire:&mdash;'I was unwilling to
  attempt the <i>quagh</i>.' (Maxwell: 'Wild Sports': Mayo, but used all
  over Ireland.) Irish <i>caedh</i> [quay], for which and for the names
  derived from it, see 'Irish Names of Places': II. 396.</p>

  <p>Quality; gentlemen and gentlewomen as distinguished from the common
  people. Out of use in England, but general in Ireland:&mdash;'Make room

  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page310"></a>{310}</span>to keep the
  chains apart in ploughing to prevent them rubbing the horses. (Cork and
  Kerry.) Irish <i>cuing</i> [quing], a yoke.</p>

  <p>Quit: in Ulster 'quit that' means <i>cease from that</i>:&mdash;'quit
  your crying.' In Queen's County they say <i>rise out of that</i>.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Rabble; used in Ulster to denote a fair where workmen congregate on
  the hiring day to be hired by the surrounding farmers. See Spalpeen.</p>

  <p>Rack. In Munster an ordinary comb is called a <i>rack</i>: the word
  <i>comb</i> being always applied and confined to a small close
  fine-toothed one.</p>

  <p>Rackrent; an excessive rent of a farm, so high as to allow to the
  occupier a bare and poor subsistence. Not used outside Ireland except so
  far as it has been recently brought into prominence by the Irish land
  question.</p>

  pocket.'</p>

  <p>Raumaush or raumaish; <i>romance</i> or fiction, but now commonly
  applied to foolish senseless brainless talk. Irish <i>rámás</i> or
  <i>rámáis</i>, which is merely adapted from the word <i>romance</i>. <!--

  <p>Raven's bit; a beast that is going to die. (Kinahan.)</p>

  <p>Red or redd; clear, clear out, clear away:&mdash;Redd the road, the
  same as the Irish <i>Fág-a-ballagh</i>, 'clear the way.' If a girl's hair
  is in bad tangles, she uses a <i>redding-comb</i> first to open it, and
  then a finer comb.</p>

  <p>Redden; to light: 'Take the bellows and redden the fire.' An Irishman
  hardly ever <i>lights</i> his pipe: he <i>reddens</i> it.</p>

  <p>Reenaw´lee; a slow-going fellow who dawdles and delays and hesitates
  about things. (Munster.) Irish <i>ríanálaidhe</i>, same sound and
  meaning: from <i>rían</i>, a way, track, or road: <i>ríanalaidhe</i> , a
  person who wanders listlessly along the <i>way</i>.</p>

  <p>Reign. This word is often used in Munster, Leinster, and Connaught, in
  the sense of to occupy, to be master of: 'Who is in the Knockea farm?'
  'Mr. Keating reigns there now.' 'Who is your landlord?' 'The old master
  is dead and his son Mr. William reigns over us now.' 'Long may <!-- Page
  312 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page312"></a>{312}</span>your
  honour [the master] reign over us.' (Crofton Croker.) In answer to an
  examination question, a young fellow from Cork once answered me,
  'Shakespeare reigned in the sixteenth century.' This usage is borrowed
  from Irish, in which the verb <i>riaghail</i> [ree-al] means both to rule
  (as a master), and to reign (as a king), and as in many other similar
  cases the two meanings were confounded in English. (Kinahan and
  myself.)</p>

  <p>Relics of old decency. When a man goes down in the world he often
  preserves some memorials of his former rank&mdash;a ring, silver buckles
  in his shoes, &amp;c.&mdash;'the relics of old decency.'</p>

  <p>Revelagh; a long lazy gadding fellow. (Morris: Monaghan.)</p>

  <i>ruibe</i> [ribbe], same meaning.</p>

  <p>Rickle; a little heap of turf peats standing on ends against each
  other. (Derry.) Irish <i>ricil</i>, same sound and meaning.</p>

  <p>Riddles, <a href="#page185">185</a>.</p>

  <p>Ride and tie. Two persons set out on a journey having one horse. One
  rides on while the other sets out on foot after him. The first man, at
  the end of a mile or two, ties up the horse at the roadside and proceeds
  on foot. When the second comes to the horse he mounts and rides till he
  is one or two miles ahead of his comrade and then ties. And so to the end
  of the journey. A common practice in old times for courier purposes; but
  not in use now, I think. <!-- Page 313 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page313"></a>{313}</span></p>

  <p>Rife, a scythe-sharpener, a narrow piece of board punctured all over
  and covered with grease on which fine sand is sprinkled. Used before the
  present emery sharpener was known. (Moran: Carlow.) Irish <i>ríabh</i>

  you did&mdash;you <i>slept rings round you</i>.'</p>

  <p>Rip; a coarse ill-conditioned woman with a bad tongue. (General.)</p>

  <p>Roach lime; lime just taken from the kiln, burnt, <i>before</i> being
  slaked and while still in the form of stones. This is old English from
  French <i>roche</i>, a rock, a stone.</p>

  <p>Roasters; potatoes kept crisping on the coals to be brought up to
  table hot at the end of the dinner&mdash;usually the largest ones picked
  out. But the word <i>roaster</i> was used only among the lower class of
  people: the higher classes considered it vulgar. Here is how Mr. Patrick
  Murray (see p. <a href="#page154">154</a>) describes them about 1840 in a
  parody on Moore's 'One bumper at parting' (a <i>lumper</i>, in Mr.
  Murray's version, means a big potato):&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'One <i>lumper</i> at parting, though many</p>
      <p class="i2">Have rolled on the board since we met,</p>
      <p>The biggest the hottest of any</p>
      <p class="i2">Remains in the round for us yet.'</p>
    </div>

  <p>In the higher class of houses they were peeled and brought up at the
  end nice and brown in <!-- Page 314 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page314"></a>{314}</span>a dish. About eighty years ago a
  well-known military gentleman of Baltinglass in the County
  Wicklow&mdash;whose daughter told me the story&mdash;had on one occasion
  a large party of friends to dinner. On the very day of the dinner the
  waiter took ill, and the stable boy&mdash;a big coarse fellow&mdash;had
  to be called in, after elaborate instructions. All went well till near
  the end of the dinner, when the fellow thought things were going on
  rather slowly. Opening the diningroom door he thrust in his head and
  called out in the hearing of all:&mdash;'Masther, are ye ready for the
  <i>roasthers</i>?' A short time ago I was looking at the house and
  diningroom where that occurred.</p>

  <p>Rocket; a little girl's frock. (Very common in Limerick.) It is of
  course an old application of the English-French <i>rochet</i>.</p>

  <p>Rodden; a <i>bohereen</i> or narrow road. (Ulster.) It is the Irish
  <i>róidín</i>, little road.</p>

  <p>Roman; used by the people in many parts of Ireland for <i>Roman
  Catholic</i>. I have already quoted what the Catholic girl said to her
  Protestant lover:&mdash;'Unless that you turn a <i>Roman</i> you ne'er
  shall get me for your bride.' Sixty or seventy years ago controversial
  discussions&mdash;between a Catholic on the one hand and a Protestant on
  the other&mdash;were very common. I witnessed many when I was a
  boy&mdash;to my great delight. Garrett Barry, a Roman Catholic, locally
  noted as a controversialist, was arguing with Mick Cantlon, surrounded by
  a group of delighted listeners. At last Garrett, as a final clincher,
  took up the Bible, opened it at a certain place, and handed it to his
  opponent, <!-- Page 315 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page315"></a>{315}</span>with:&mdash;'Read that heading out for us
  now if you please.' Mick took it up and read 'St. Paul's Epistle to the
  <i>Romans</i>.' 'Very well,' says Garrett: 'now can you show me in any
  part of that Bible, 'St. Paul's Epistle to the <i>Protestants</i>'? This
  of course was a down blow; and Garrett was greeted with a great hurrah by
  the Catholic part of his audience. This story is in 'Knocknagow,' but the
  thing occurred in my neighbourhood, and I heard about it long before
  'Knocknagow' was written.</p>

  <p>Rookaun; great noisy merriment. Also a drinking-bout. (Limerick.)</p>

  <p>Room. In a peasant's house the <i>room</i> is a special apartment
  distinct from the kitchen or living-room, which is not a 'room' in this
  sense at all. I slept in the kitchen and John slept in the 'room.' (Healy
  and myself: Munster.)</p>

  <p>Round coal; coal in lumps as distinguished from slack or coal broken
  up small and fine.</p>

  <p>Ruction, ructions; fighting, squabbling, a fight, a row. It is a
  memory of the <i>Insurrection</i> of 1798, which was commonly called the
  'Ruction.'</p>

  <p>Rue-rub; when a person incautiously scratches an itchy spot so as to
  break the skin: that is <i>rue-rub</i>. (Derry.) From <i>rue</i>, regret
  or sorrow.</p>

  <p>Rury; a rough hastily-made cake or bannock. (Morris: Monaghan.)</p>

  <p>Rut; the smallest bonnive in a litter. (Kildare and Carlow.)</p>

  316 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page316"></a>{316}</span></p>

  <p>Saulavotcheer; a person having <i>lark-heels</i>. (Limerick.) The
  first syll. is Irish; <i>sál</i> [saul], heel.</p>

  <p>Sauvaun; a rest, a light doze or nap. (Munster.) Irish <i>sámhán</i>,
  same sound and meaning, from <i>sámh</i> [sauv], pleasant and
  tranquil.</p>

  <p>Scagh; a whitethorn bush. (General.) Irish <i>sceach</i>, same sound
  and meaning.</p>

  <p>Scaghler: a little fish&mdash;the pinkeen or thornback: Irish
  <i>sceach</i> [scagh], a thorn or thornbush, and the English termination
  <i>ler</i>.</p>

  <p>Scald: to be <i>scalded</i> is to be annoyed, mortified, sorely
  troubled, vexed. (Very general.) Translated from one or the other of two
  Irish words, <i>loisc</i> [lusk], to burn; and <i>scall</i>, to
  <i>scald</i>. Finn Bane says:&mdash;'Guary being angry with me he
  scorched me (<i>romloisc</i>), burned me, <i>scalded</i> me, with abuse.'
  ('Colloquy.') 'I earned that money hard and 'tis a great
  <i>heart-scald</i> (<i>scollach-croidhe</i>) to me to lose it.' There is
  an Irish air called 'The <i>Scalded</i> poor man.' ('Old Irish Music and
  Songs.')</p>

  <p>Scalder, an unfledged bird (South): <i>scaldie</i> and
  <i>scaulthoge</i> in the North. From the Irish <i>scal</i> (bald), from
  which comes the Irish <i>scalachán</i>, an unfledged bird.</p>

  <p>Scallan; a wooden shed to shelter the priest during Mass, <a
  href="#page143">143</a>, <a href="#page145">145</a>.</p>

  <p>Scalp, scolp, scalpeen; a rude cabin, usually roofed with
  <i>scalps</i> or grassy sods (whence the name). In the famine
  times&mdash;1847 and after&mdash;a scalp was often erected for any poor
  wanderer who got stricken down with typhus fever: and in that the people
  tended him cautiously till he recovered or died. (Munster.) Irish
  <i>scaílp</i> [scolp]. <!-- Page 317 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page317"></a>{317}</span></p>

  <p>Scalteen: see Scolsheen.</p>

  <p>Scollagh-cree; ill-treatment of any kind. (Moran: Carlow.) Irish
  <i>scallach-croidhe</i>, same sound and meaning: a 'heart scald'; from
  <i>scalladh</i>, scalding, and <i>croidhe</i>, heart.</p>

  <p>Scollop; the bended rod pointed at both ends that a thatcher uses to
  fasten down the several straw-wisps. (General.) Irish <i>scolb</i>
  [scollub].</p>

  <p>Scolsheen or scalteen; made by boiling a mixture of whiskey, water,
  sugar, butter and pepper (or caraway seeds) in a pot: a sovereign cure
  for a cold. In the old mail-car days there was an inn on the road from
  Killarney to Mallow, famous for scolsheen, where a big pot of it was
  always kept ready for travellers. (Kinahan and Kane.) Sometimes the word
  <i>scalteen</i> was applied to unmixed whiskey burned, and used for the
  same purpose. From the Irish <i>scall</i>, burn, singe, <i>scald</i>.</p>

  <p>Sconce; to chaff, banter, make game of:&mdash;'None of your sconcing.'
  (Ulster.)</p>

  <p>Sconce; to shirk work or duty. (Moran: Carlow.)</p>

  <p>Scotch Dialect: influence of, on our Dialect, <a href="#page6">6</a>,
  <a href="#page7">7</a>.</p>

  <p>Scotch lick; when a person goes to clean up anything&mdash;a saucepan,
  a floor, his face, a pair of shoes, &amp;c.&mdash;and only half does it,
  he (or she) has given it a <i>Scotch lick</i>. General in South. In
  Dublin it would be called a 'cat's lick': for a cat has only a small
  tongue and doesn't do much in the way of licking.</p>

  <p>Scout; a reproachful name for a bold forward girl.</p>

  <p>Scouther; to burn a cake on the outside before it is fully cooked, by
  over haste in baking:&mdash;burned outside, half raw inside. Hence 'to
  scouther' <!-- Page 318 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page318"></a>{318}</span>means to do anything hastily and
  incompletely. (Ulster.)</p>

  (Patterson: Ulster.) In the South it is <i>scraub</i>:&mdash;'He scraubed
  my face.'</p>

  they are afterwards turned out by plough or spade.</p>

  <p>Scraddhin; a scrap; anything small&mdash;smaller than usual, as a
  small potato: applied contemptuously to a very small man, exactly the

  and meaning. (East Ulster.)</p>

  <p>Scran; 'bad scran to you,' an evil wish like 'bad luck to you,' but
  much milder: English, in which <i>scran</i> means broken victuals,
  food-refuse, fare&mdash;very common. (North and South.)</p>

  <p>Scraw; a grassy sod cut from a grassy or boggy surface and often dried
  for firing; also called <i>scrahoge</i> (with diminutive <i>óg</i>).

  anything. (Armagh.)</p>

  <p>Scut; the tail of a hare or rabbit: often applied in scorn to a
  contemptible fellow:&mdash;'He's just a scut and nothing better.' The
  word is Irish, as is shown by the following quotation:&mdash;'The billows
  [were] conversing with the <i>scuds</i> (sterns) and the beautiful prows
  [of the ships].' (Battle of Moylena: and note by Kuno Meyer in 'Rev.
  Celt.') (General.)</p>

  [see], to sit, with diminutive.</p>

  <p>Set: all over Ireland they use <i>set</i> instead of <i>let</i> [a
  house or lodging]. A struggling housekeeper failed to let her lodging,
  which a neighbour explained by:&mdash;'Ah she's no good at

  <p>Skellig, Skellig List&mdash;On the Great Skellig rock in the Atlantic,
  off the coast of Kerry, are the ruins of a monastery, to which people at
  one time went on pilgrimage&mdash;and a difficult pilgrimage it was. The
  tradition is still kept up in some places, though in an odd form; in
  connection with the custom that marriages are not solemnised in Lent,
  i.e. after Shrove Tuesday. It is well within my memory that&mdash;in the
  south of Ireland&mdash;young persons who should have been married before
  Ash-Wednesday, but were not, were supposed to set out on pilgrimage to
  Skellig on Shrove Tuesday night: but it was all a make-believe. Yet I
  remember witnessing occasionally some play in mock imitation of the
  pilgrimage. It was usual for a local bard to compose what was called a
  'Skellig List'&mdash;a jocose rhyming catalogue of the unmarried men and
  women of the neighbourhood who went on the sorrowful journey&mdash;which
  was circulated on Shrove Tuesday and for some time after. Some of these
  were witty and amusing: but occasionally they were scurrilous and
  offensive doggerel. They were generally too long for singing; but I
  remember one&mdash;a good one too&mdash;which&mdash;when I was very
  young&mdash;I heard sung to a spirited air. It is represented here by a
  single verse, the only one I remember. (See also 'Chalk Sunday,' p. <a

  Many of these struggling men acted as intermediaries between the big corn

  <p>Squireen; an Irish gentleman in a small way who apes the manners, the
  authoritative tone, and the aristocratic bearing of the large landed
  proprietors. Sometimes you can hardly distinguish a squireen from a
  <i>half-sir</i> or from a <i>shoneen</i>. Sometimes the squireen was the
  son of the old squire: a worthless young fellow, who loafed about doing
  nothing, instead of earning an honest livelihood: but he was too grand
  for that. The word is a diminutive of <i>squire</i>, applied here in
  contempt, like many other diminutives. The class of squireen is nearly
  extinct: 'Joy be with them.'</p>

  <p>Str. Most of the following words beginning with <i>str</i> are derived
  from Irish words beginning with <i>sr</i>. For as this combination
  <i>sr</i> does not exist in English, when an Irish word with this
  beginning is borrowed into English, a <i>t</i> is always inserted between
  the <i>s</i> and <i>r</i> to bring it into conformity with English usage
  and to render it more easily pronounced by English-speaking tongues. See
  this subject discussed in 'Irish Names of Places,' <!-- Page 336 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page336"></a>{336}</span>vol. <span

  I once heard it <!-- Page 337 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page337"></a>{337}</span>applied under odd circumstances when I was
  very young. Bartholomew Power was long and lanky, with his clothes
  hanging loose on him. On the morning when he and his newly-married
  wife&mdash;whom I knew well, and who was then no chicken&mdash;were
  setting out for his home, I walked a bit of the way with the happy bride
  to take leave of her. Just when we were about to part, she turned and
  said to me&mdash;these were her very words&mdash;'Well Mr. Joyce, you
  know the number of nice young men I came across in my day (naming half a

  <p>Variety of Phrases, A, <a href="#page185">185</a>.</p>

  <p>Venom, generally pronounced <i>vinnom</i>; energy:&mdash;'He does his
  work with great venom.' An attempted translation from an Irish word that
  bears more than one meaning, and the wrong meaning is brought into
  English:&mdash;viz. <i>neim</i> or <i>neimh</i>, literally <i>poison</i>,
  <i>venom</i>, but figuratively <i>fierceness</i>, <i>energy</i>. John
  O'Dugan writes in Irish (500 years ago):&mdash;<i>Ris gach ndruing do
  niad a neim</i>: 'against every tribe they [the Clann Ferrall] exert
  their <i>neim</i>' (literally their <i>poison</i>, but meaning their
  energy or bravery). So also the three sons of Fiacha are endowed
  <i>coisin neim</i> 'with fierceness,' lit. with <i>poison</i> or
  <i>venom</i>. (Silva Gadelica.) In an old Irish tale a lady looks with
  intense earnestness on a man she admires: in the Irish it is said 'She
  put <i>nimh a súl</i> on him, literally the '<i>venom</i> of her eyes,'
  meaning the keenest glance of her eyes.</p>

  <p>Hence over a large part of Ireland, especially the South, you will
  hear: 'Ah, Dick is a splendid man to hire: he works with such
  <i>venom</i>.' A countryman (Co. Wicklow), speaking of the new National
  Teacher:&mdash;'Indeed sir he's well enough, but for all that he hasn't
  the <i>vinnom</i> of poor Mr. O'Brien:' i.e. he does not teach with such
  energy.</p>

  <p>Very fond; when there is a long spell of rain, frost, &amp;c., people
  say:&mdash;'It is very fond of the rain,' &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Voteen; a person who is a <i>devotee</i> in religion: nearly always
  applied in derision to one who is excessively and ostentatiously
  devotional. (General.)</p>

<p><!-- Page 346 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page346"></a>{346}</span></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Wad; a wisp of straw or hay pressed tightly together. A broken pane in
  a window is often stuffed with a wad of straw. 'Careless and gay, like a
  wad in a window': old saying. (General.)</p>

  <p>Walsh, Edward, <a href="#page5">5</a>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Wangle; the handful of straw a thatcher grasps in his left hand from
  time to time while thatching, twisted up tight at one end. By extension
  of meaning applied to a tall lanky weak young fellow. (Moran: middle
  eastern counties.)</p>

  <p>Wangrace; oatmeal gruel for sick persons. (Simmons: Armagh.)</p>

  <p>Want; often used in Ulster in the following way:&mdash;'I asked Dick
  to come back to us, for we couldn't want him,' i.e. couldn't do without
  him.</p>

  <p>Wap; a bundle of straw; as a verb, to make up straw into a bundle.
  (Derry and Monaghan.)</p>

  <p>Warrant; used all over Ireland in the following way&mdash;nearly
  always with <i>good</i>, <i>better</i>, or <i>best</i>, but sometimes
  with <i>bad</i>:&mdash;'You're a good warrant (a good hand) to play for
  us [at hurling] whenever we ax you.' ('Knocknagow.') 'She was a good
  warrant to give a poor fellow a meal when he wanted it': 'Father Patt
  gave me a tumbler of <i>rale</i> stiff punch, and the divel a better
  warrant to make the same was within the province of Connaught.' ('Wild
  Sports of the West.')</p>

  <p>Watch-pot; a person who sneaks into houses about meal times hoping to
  get a bit or to be asked to join.</p>

  <p>Way. 'A dairyman's <i>way</i>, a labourer's <i>way</i>, means the
  privileges or perquisites which the dairyman or labourer gets, in
  addition to the main contract. A <!-- Page 347 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page347"></a>{347}</span><i>way</i> might be
  grazing for a sheep, a patch of land for potatoes, &amp;c.' (Healy: for
  Waterford.)</p>

  <p>Wearables; articles of clothing. In Tipperary they call the
  old-fashioned wig 'Dwyer's wearable.'</p>

  <p>Weather-blade, in Armagh, the same as 'Goureen-roe' in the South,
  which see.</p>

  <p>Wee (North), weeny (South); little.</p>

  <p>Well became. 'When Tom Cullen heard himself insulted by the master,
  well became him he up and defied him and told him he'd stay no longer in
  his house.' 'Well became' here expresses approval of Tom's action as
  being the correct and becoming thing to do. I said to little Patrick 'I
  don't like to give you any more sweets you're so near your dinner'; and
  well became him he up and said:&mdash;'Oh I get plenty of sweets at home
  before my dinner.' 'Well became Tom he paid the whole bill.'</p>

  <p>Wersh, warsh, worsh; insipid, tasteless, needing salt or sugar.
  (Simmons and Patterson: Ulster.)</p>

  <p>Wet and dry; 'Tom gets a shilling a day, wet and dry'; i.e. constant
  work and constant pay in all weathers. (General.)</p>

  <p>Whack: food, sustenance:&mdash;'He gets 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day
  and his <i>whack</i>.'</p>

  <p>Whassah or fassah; to feed cows in some unusual place, such as along a
  lane or road: to herd them in unfenced ground. The food so given is also
  called <i>whassah</i>. (Moran: for South Mon.) Irish <i>fásach</i>, a
  wilderness, any wild place.</p>

  <p>Whatever; at any rate, anyway, anyhow: usually put in this sense at
  the end of a sentence:&mdash;'Although she can't speak on other days of
  <!-- Page 348 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page348"></a>{348}</span>the week, she can speak on Friday,
  whatever.' ('Collegians.') 'Although you wouldn't take anything else,
  you'll drink this glass of milk, whatever.' (Munster.)</p>

  <p>Curious, I find this very idiom in an English book recently published:
  'Lord Tweedmouth. Notes and Recollections,' viz.:&mdash;'We could not
  cross the river [in Scotland], but he would go [across] <i>whatever</i>.'
  The writer evidently borrowed this from the English dialect of the
  Highlands, where they use <i>whatever</i> exactly as we do. (William
  Black: 'A Princess of Thule.') In all these cases, whether Irish or
  Scotch, <i>whatever</i> is a translation from the Gaelic <i>ar mhodh ar
  bíth</i> or some such phrase.</p>

  <p>Wheeling. When a fellow went about flourishing a cudgel and shouting
  out defiance to people to fight him&mdash;shouting for his faction, side,
  or district, he was said to be 'wheeling':&mdash;'Here's for Oola!'
  'here's <i>three years</i>!' 'here's Lillis!' (Munster.) Sometimes called
  <i>hurrooing</i>. See 'Three-years-old.'</p>

  <p>Wheen; a small number, a small quantity:&mdash;'I was working for a
  wheen o' days': 'I'll eat a wheen of these gooseberries.' (Ulster.)</p>

  <p>Whenever is generally used in Ulster for <i>when</i>:&mdash;'I was in
  town this morning and whenever I came home I found the calf dead in the
  stable.'</p>

  <p>Which. When a person does not quite catch what another says, there is
  generally a query:&mdash;'eh?' 'what?' or 'what's that you say?' Our
  people often express this query by the single word 'which?' I knew a
  highly educated and highly <!-- Page 349 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page349"></a>{349}</span>placed Dublin official who always so used
  the word. (General.)</p>

  <p>Whipster; a bold forward romping impudent girl. (Ulster.) In Limerick
  it also conveys the idea of a girl inclined to <i>whip</i> or steal
  things.</p>

  <p>Whisht, silence: used all over Ireland in such phrases as 'hold your
  whisht' (or the single word 'whisht'), i.e., be silent. It is the Gaelic
  word <i>tost</i>, silence, with the first <i>t</i> aspirated as it ought
  to be, which gives it the sound of <i>h</i>. They pronounce it as if it
  were written <i>thuist</i>, which is exactly sounded <i>whisht</i>. The
  same word&mdash;taken from the Gaelic of course&mdash;is used everywhere
  in Scotland:&mdash;When the Scottish Genius of Poetry appeared suddenly
  to Burns (in 'The Vision'):&mdash;'Ye needna doubt, I held my
  whisht!'</p>

  <p>Whisper, whisper here; both used in the sense of 'listen,' 'listen to
  me':&mdash;'Whisper, I want to say something to you,' and then he
  proceeds to say it, not in a whisper, but in the usual low conversational
  tone. Very general all over Ireland. 'Whisper' in this usage is simply a
  translation of <i>cogar</i> [cogger], and 'whisper here' of <i>cogar
  annso</i>; these Irish words being used by Irish speakers exactly as
  their dialectical English equivalents are used in English: the English
  usage being taken from the Irish.</p>

  <p>White-headed boy or white-haired boy; a favourite, a person in favour,
  whether man or boy:&mdash;'Oh you're the white-headed boy now.'</p>

  <p>Whitterit or whitrit; a weasel. (Ulster.)</p>

  <p>Whose owe? the same as 'who owns?':&mdash;'Whose owe is this book?'
  Old English. My correspondent <!-- Page 350 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page350"></a>{350}</span>states that this was a common construction
  in Anglo-Saxon. (Ulster.)</p>

  <p>Why; a sort of terminal expletive used in some of the Munster
  counties:&mdash;'Tom is a strong boy why': 'Are you going to Ennis why?'
  'I am going to Cork why.'</p>

  <p>Why for? used in Ulster as an equivalent to 'for what?'</p>

  <p>Why but? 'Why not?' (Ulster.) 'Why but you speak your mind out?' i.e.
  'Why should you not?' (Kane: Armagh.)</p>

  <p>Why then; used very much in the South to begin a sentence, especially
  a reply, much as <i>indeed</i> is used in English:&mdash;'When did you
  see John Dunn?' 'Why then I met him yesterday at the fair': 'Which do you
  like best, tea or coffee?' 'Why then I much prefer tea.' 'Why then Pat is
  that you; and how is <i>every rope's length</i> of you?'</p>

  <p>Wicked; used in the South in the sense of severe or cross. 'Mr.
  Manning our schoolmaster is very wicked.'</p>

  <p>Widow-woman and widow-man; are used for <i>widow</i> and
  <i>widower</i>, especially in Ulster: but <i>widow-woman</i> is heard
  everywhere.</p>

  <p>Wigs on the green; a fight: so called for an obvious
  reason:&mdash;'There will be wigs on the green in the fair to-day.'</p>

  <p><i>Will you</i> was never a good fellow, <a href="#page18">18</a>, <a
  href="#page114">114</a>.</p>

  <p>Wine or wynd of hay; a small temporary stack of hay, made up on the
  meadow. All the small wynds are ultimately made up into one large rick or
  stack in the farmyard. <!-- Page 351 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page351"></a>{351}</span></p>

  <p>Wipe, a blow: all over Ireland: he gave him a wipe on the face. In
  Ulster, a goaly-wipe is a great blow on the ball with the <i>camaun</i>
  or hurley: such as will send it to the goal.</p>

  <p>Wire. To <i>wire in</i> is to begin work vigorously: to join in a
  fight.</p>

  <p>Wirra; an exclamation generally indicating surprise, sorrow, or
  vexation: it is the vocative of 'Muire' (<i>A Mhuire</i>), Mary, that is,
  the Blessed Virgin.</p>

  <p>Wirrasthru, a term of pity; alas. It is the phonetic form of <i>A
  Mhuire is truaigh</i>, 'O Mary it is a pity (or a sorrow),' implying the
  connexion of the Blessed Virgin with sorrow.</p>

  <p>Wit; sense, which is the original meaning. But this meaning is nearly
  lost in England while it is extant everywhere in Ireland:&mdash;A sharp
  Ulster woman, entering her little boy in a Dublin Infant School, begged
  of the mistress to teach him a little <i>wut</i>.</p>

  <p>Witch: black witches are bad; white witches good. (West Donegal.)</p>

  <p>Wish; esteem, friendship:&mdash;'Your father had a great wish for me,'
  i.e. held me in particular esteem, had a strong friendship. (General.) In
  this application it is merely the translation of the Irish <i>meas</i>,
  respect:&mdash;<i>Tá meás mór agum ort</i>; I have great esteem for you,
  I have a great <i>wish</i> for you, I hold you in great respect.</p>

  <p>Wisha; a softening down of <i>mossa</i>, which see.</p>

  <p>With that; thereupon: used all over Ireland. Irish <i>leis sin</i>,
  which is often used, has the same exact meaning; but still I think
  <i>with that</i> is of old <!-- Page 352 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page352"></a>{352}</span>English origin, though the Irish
  equivalent may have contributed to its popularity.</p>

  <p>Word; trace, sign. (Ulster.) 'Did you see e'er a word of a
  black-avised (black-visaged) man travelling the road you came?'</p>

  <p>Wrap and run: 'I gathered up every penny I could wrap and run,' is
  generally used: the idea being to wrap up hastily and run for it.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Yoke; any article, contrivance, or apparatus for use in some work.
  'That's a <i>quare</i> yoke Bill,' says a countryman when he first saw a
  motor car.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><a name="Nt1" href="#NtA1">[1]</a> For both of these songs see my 'Old
  Irish Folk Music and Songs.'</p>

  <p><a name="Nt2" href="#NtA2">[2]</a> See my 'Old Irish Folk Music and

  <p><a name="Nt3" href="#NtA3">[3]</a> See the interesting remarks of
  O'Donovan in Preface to 'Battle of Magh Rath,' pp. ix-xv. Sir Samuel
  Ferguson also has some valuable observations on the close packing of the
  very old Irish language, but I cannot lay my hands on them. From him I
  quote (from memory) the remark about translating old Irish into English
  or Latin.</p>
